Pleural Infections

Exam Mapping & Scope
This chapter covers evaluation and management of pleural space infections across the spectrum from complicated parapneumonic effusions to empyema, emphasizing risk stratification (RAPID), chest tube selection, intrapleural enzyme therapy, saline irrigation, surgical escalation, and special populations. Guidance reflects contemporary society statements and pragmatic pathways tested in trials summarized in the provided materials.

Learning Objectives

Distinguish simple vs complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema using ultrasound, CT features, and pleural fluid chemistry.

Apply a stepwise, time‑bounded pathway for source control (tube drainage → intrapleural therapy or irrigation → surgery) with reassessment at ~48 hours.

Choose appropriate drain size and placement strategy, and implement best‑practice intrapleural tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and DNase dosing—including dose reduction when bleeding risk is high.

Initiate empiric, setting‑appropriate antibiotics and transition to targeted therapy; understand when shorter antibiotic durations may be reasonable.

Use the RAPID score to communicate risk, guide intensity of care, and anticipate outcomes.

Recognize when early surgical consultation is indicated and tailor management for trauma, tuberculosis, fungal infection, and transplant recipients.

High‑Yield One‑Pager

Terminology: “Pleural infection” encompasses complicated parapneumonic effusion (CPPE) and empyema; management principles are aligned.

Epidemiology: Incidence and hospitalizations have increased; older adults bear a disproportionate rise and higher mortality.

Don’t delay: Progression from “simple” to “complicated” can occur rapidly—act decisively.

Imaging: Thoracic ultrasound (TUS) reliably identifies septations/loculations and guides safe access; CT helps delineate anatomy and demonstrates the “split pleura” sign.

Chemistry that matters: pH <=7.20 (obtained correctly) → place a chest tube if safe. If pH 7.21-7.39, integrate LDH (>900 IU/L), glucose (<=4 mmol/L ≈ 72 mg/dL), and imaging to decide. Purulence, positive Gram/culture, or glucose <60 mg/dL also strengthen the case for drainage.

Drain choice: Small‑bore (<=14F) tubes are preferred (less pain, similar efficacy). Flush regularly to maintain patency.

Reassess at ~48 h: If persistent collection plus systemic inflammation → escalate (CT, intrapleural therapy or surgery).

Intrapleural therapy (IET): Use tPA 10 mg + DNase 5 mg twice daily for up to 3 days; clamp ~1 hour each dose. Consider tPA 5 mg with standard DNase in high bleeding risk. Avoid fibrinolytic monotherapy.

Anticoagulation: Hold if possible before IET; if not feasible, use reduced‑dose tPA with DNase or consider saline irrigation.

Saline irrigation: 250 mL normal saline TID for 3 days can reduce radiographic burden and surgical referral when IET/surgery are contraindicated.

When to call surgery early: Unstable/septic patients, organized stage 3 with thick rind/non‑expandable lung, or failure after an adequate IET course. Prefer VATS over open thoracotomy when feasible.

Antibiotics: Start promptly; cover Gram‑positives and anaerobes in community‑acquired and add Gram‑negatives (±Pseudomonas) in hospital‑acquired; tailor to culture and clinical progress.

RAPID score: Predicts 90‑day mortality and helps goal‑setting and escalation planning.

Common traps: Misinterpreting pH due to sampling errors; relying on chest X‑ray alone; waiting for cultures before draining; placing a large‑bore tube by default; using streptokinase or DNase monotherapy.

Core Concepts
Pathophysiology / Epidemiology

Pleural infection arises when exudative effusion becomes infected, typically with neutrophil‑predominant fluid. Routes include contiguous pneumonia, transdiaphragmatic spread from abdominal infection, mediastinal extension, hematogenous seeding, and direct inoculation (surgery, trauma). Anaerobes are frequent—consider dental disease and aspiration risks. Incidence has climbed over the past decade, with male predominance and higher mortality in older adults; pleural infection is resource‑intense (length of stay commonly 12-15 days or more).

Indications & Contraindications

Drainage is indicated for: purulent fluid; positive Gram stain/culture; pH <=7.20; or intermediate pH with high‑risk features (LDH >900 IU/L, glucose <=4 mmol/L/72 mg/dL or <60 mg/dL, complex ultrasound, large effusion, pleural enhancement). Avoid delays; bedside pH testing during the same procedure enables immediate conversion from diagnostic tap to small‑bore tube. Up‑front VATS is not generally first‑line in stable adults, but early surgical consultation is warranted for instability, organized stage 3 disease, or tube failure.

Pre‑procedure Evaluation

Imaging: TUS to confirm and map pockets and septations; CT (venous “pleural” phase) to define anatomy, detect split‑pleura sign, and plan access/escalation when needed.

Labs: CBC, renal function (RAPID), coagulation profile if IET/surgery anticipated.

Pleural sampling: Correct technique for pH (heparin‑free ABG syringe, no lidocaine contamination, air expelled, timely analysis).

Consent: Discuss staged pathway (tube → IET/irrigation → surgery) and potential complications (bleeding with IET, air leak after decortication).

Equipment & Setup

Drain: Image‑guided <=14F pigtail catheter preferred; place to suction and flush regularly to prevent occlusion.

Adjuncts: Three‑way stopcock, sterile normal saline for flushes, securement sutures/dressing to prevent dislodgement.

IET: tPA and DNase available at bedside with clamps; plan for 1‑hour dwell.

Step‑by‑Step Technique / Procedural Checklist

Confirm target with TUS; mark safe window.

Asepsis & anesthesia; small skin nick; Seldinger placement of <=14F tube into largest or most septated pocket.

Secure & connect to drainage; flush with saline to maintain patency.

Send fluid for pH (immediate), glucose, protein/LDH (±Light’s), Gram stain/culture (include blood culture bottles), and cytology.

Start antibiotics promptly (see Table 2).

Assess at ~48 h: if residual collection plus systemic inflammation (e.g., <50% CRP fall or persistent SIRS), obtain CT and escalate (IET/irrigation or surgery).

IET regimen (typical): tPA 10 mg then DNase 5 mg, both twice daily for up to 3 days, clamp ~1 hour after each instillation; consider tPA 5 mg + DNase 5 mg when bleeding risk is high. Avoid monotherapy.

Troubleshooting & Intra‑procedure Management

Poor drainage: Confirm tube position with TUS/CT; flush; consider additional catheter into separate locule; if still inadequate, proceed to IET or irrigation depending on bleeding risk.

Bleeding suspicion during IET: Don’t confuse pink drainage with true bleed—check pleural fluid hematocrit; pause/adjust dosing if needed.

Unstable patient post‑tube: Early surgical consultation; many will benefit from timely VATS for debridement/decortication.

Post‑procedure Care & Follow‑up

Antibiotics: Start empirically, tailor as cultures return; transition IV→PO when clinically improving and inflammatory markers fall; typical total duration ≈ 4 weeks after adequate source control, though shorter courses are under study.

Monitoring: Daily clinical exam, drain output, inflammatory markers; imaging to assess clearance.

Discharge planning: Ensure clinical response before tube removal; arrange follow‑up at 2-4 weeks and again at 8-12 weeks for radiographic resolution and to detect recurrence.

Complications (Prevention, Recognition, Management)

IET‑related pain/bleeding: Pain impacts ~15%; pleural bleeding ~3-5%—most managed with transfusion alone. Mitigate by dose reduction (tPA 5 mg) when anticoagulation cannot be safely paused; avoid in systemic coagulopathy.

Tube issues: Dislodgement (securement), blockage (regular flushes), infection at insertion site (asepsis).

Surgical complications: Prolonged air leak, atrial fibrillation, residual space; risk rises with longer symptom duration and advanced stage.

Special Populations

Trauma/retained hemothorax: Higher risk for empyema; management includes redrainage, IET (non‑streptokinase options), and early VATS when indicated.

Tuberculous empyema (stage 3): Thick pleural rind limits drug penetration; optimal care often requires decortication plus anti‑TB therapy; VATS feasible in selected cases, with longer operative time and blood loss than pyogenic disease.

Fungal empyema: Rare but severe (higher ICU needs and mortality); requires antifungals with good pleural penetration and often surgical source control.

Lung transplant: Early, aggressive drainage; IET used sparingly due to anastomosis concerns; surgery less aggressive with tolerance for residual spaces; indwelling tunneled catheter may help gradual expansion.

High bleeding risk / mandatory anticoagulation: Prefer reduced‑dose tPA with DNase, or use saline irrigation if lytics contraindicated; consider early VATS if operative risk acceptable.

Evidence & Outcomes

Key points include: equivalence of small vs larger tubes for major outcomes but less pain with <=14F; IET (tPA+DNase) improves radiographic clearance and reduces surgery and length of stay compared with standard care; pleural irrigation reduces radiographic burden and surgical referral in pilot data; VATS is preferred to open thoracotomy when surgery is needed; up‑front VATS as initial drainage lacks robust evidence in stable adults; feasibility work comparing early VATS to IET shows equipoise, with definitive trials ongoing.

```


Bulleted algorithm (parallel):

Suspect infection → TUS to confirm/drain map.

If drainable, perform diagnostic tap with immediate pH.

Purulent/+Gram/+culture OR pH <=7.20 → insert <=14F tube and start antibiotics.

Intermediate pH (7.21-7.39) → integrate LDH, glucose, imaging; if high‑risk features present, insert tube.

pH >=7.40 → antibiotics alone with close surveillance.

Q -- Yes --> S[Saline irrigation 250 mL TID x 3 days]
R & S --> T{Cleared?}
T -- Yes --> U[Continue antibiotics; plan tube removal]
T -- No --> P
```


Bulleted algorithm (parallel):

48‑hour checkpoint: if residual collection plus inadequate inflammatory response → CT and escalate.

Unstable/organized stage 3: involve surgery; VATS preferred when feasible.

Otherwise choose IET (tPA + DNase); use reduced‑dose tPA if bleeding risk high or anticoagulation cannot be paused.

If IET contraindicated, consider saline irrigation.

Persistent failure → surgical referral, or indwelling tunneled catheter if not a surgical candidate.

Cases & Applied Learning

Case 1 — Early decision‑making
A 66‑year‑old with right‑sided pneumonia has fever and pleuritic pain. TUS: moderate effusion; anechoic. Diagnostic tap performed with immediate pH measurement shows pH 7.18.
Best answer: Insert a <=14F chest tube during the same session and start antibiotics. Explanation: pH <=7.20 is a high‑risk biochemical feature mandating drainage when safe to do so. Immediate pH testing enables conversion from tap to tube and avoids delay.

Case 2 — 48‑hour checkpoint
A 58‑year‑old with a 12F pigtail for CPPE shows persistent fever, CRP down by only 20%, and CT reveals sizeable residual locule.
Best answer: Start tPA 10 mg + DNase 5 mg BID for up to 3 days (consider tPA 5 mg if bleeding risk) and reassess. Explanation: At ~48 h, residual collection plus inadequate inflammatory improvement triggers escalation. IET is preferred in fibrinopurulent disease; proceed to surgery if IET fails or stage 3 features dominate.

Case 3 — Anticoagulation constraint
A 72‑year‑old on therapeutic anticoagulation for acute VTE cannot pause treatment. Residual CPPE persists despite tube drainage.
Best answer: Reduced‑dose tPA 5 mg + DNase 5 mg with careful monitoring, or saline irrigation if bleeding risk is unacceptable. Explanation: Dose reduction mitigates bleeding risk when anticoagulation cannot be interrupted; irrigation is an alternative where IET is contraindicated.

Question Bank (MCQs)

1. Which statement is accurate regarding pleural infections?
A. Incidence is declining in older adults.
B. Progression from simple to complicated typically takes weeks.
C. Pleural infection rarely occurs without ipsilateral pneumonia.
D. Recent datasets show notable inpatient mortality.
E. Most cases are eosinophilic exudates.
Answer: D. Mortality remains substantial in contemporary cohorts; incidence has increased, particularly in older adults, and non‑pneumonic mechanisms (hematogenous, subdiaphragmatic, iatrogenic) are not rare. Rapid progression can occur within 24 hours.

2. A patient with right‑sided pneumonia has an anechoic effusion. Immediate pleural fluid pH is 7.18. Next best step?
A. Begin antibiotics only.
B. Insert a <=14F chest tube now.
C. Send glucose and await results.
D. Plan VATS drainage.
E. Repeat thoracentesis tomorrow.
Answer: B. pH <=7.20 warrants chest drain placement when safe; delaying drainage risks deterioration.

3. After 48 h of tube drainage, CT shows a sizeable residual collection and CRP has fallen by only 20%. Patient is stable. Best next step?
A. Remove the tube.
B. Start tPA/DNase BID for up to 3 days.
C. Switch to larger‑bore tube.
D. Immediate thoracotomy.
E. Repeat diagnostic tap.
Answer: B. Poor progress at ~48 h triggers escalation; IET is appropriate in stable patients with fibrinopurulent disease, while surgery is typically reserved for failure or organized stage 3.

4. A patient on non‑interrupible anticoagulation has a residual empyema after tube placement. Which regimen is acceptable?
A. DNase alone.
B. Streptokinase + DNase.
C. tPA 5 mg + DNase 5 mg BID.
D. tPA 10 mg alone.
E. No further therapy possible.
Answer: C. Reduced‑dose tPA with standard DNase maintains efficacy with lower bleeding risk; streptokinase and monotherapy are discouraged.

5. During IET, drainage turns pink but the patient is stable. Best action?
A. Stop therapy and transfuse.
B. Measure pleural fluid hematocrit to confirm bleed.
C. Increase tPA dose.
D. Switch to DNase alone.
E. Proceed to VATS immediately.
Answer: B. Pink discoloration is expected; confirm true bleeding with pleural hematocrit before changing therapy.

6. Best empiric regimen for hospital‑acquired pleural infection with MRSA and Pseudomonas risk?
A. Amoxicillin alone.
B. Piperacillin‑tazobactam plus vancomycin.
C. Metronidazole monotherapy.
D. Aminoglycoside monotherapy.
E. Co‑trimoxazole alone.
Answer: B. Broad Gram‑negative (including Pseudomonas) plus MRSA coverage is recommended initially; aminoglycosides have poor pleural penetration and co‑trimoxazole may not achieve adequate pleural levels.

7. Which statement about chest tubes in pleural infection is correct?
A. Larger tubes reduce mortality.
B. Small‑bore (<=14F) tubes are associated with less pain and similar outcomes.
C. Tubes should not be flushed.
D. Image guidance is optional.
E. Tubes should be routinely upsized after 24 h.
Answer: B. Prospective data indicate small‑bore tubes achieve similar key outcomes with less pain; regular flushing helps maintain patency.

8. Which finding most strongly favors early surgical referral?
A. pH 7.25 with free‑flowing effusion.
B. Stage 2 fibrinopurulent disease with rapid improvement on IET.
C. Persistent sepsis with organized rind and trapped lung.
D. Single locule drained completely.
E. Falling inflammatory markers at 48 h.
Answer: C. Organized stage 3 with thick visceral rind and non‑expandable lung is a classic indication for earlier surgical management, often by VATS decortication.

9. TB empyema truths include:
A. Responds well to fibrinolytic monotherapy.
B. Often requires decortication plus anti‑TB therapy for optimal outcomes.
C. DNase is contraindicated in TB.
D. Surgery is usually avoided due to bleeding risk alone.
E. Always managed with open thoracotomy.
Answer: B. Thick rind and high organism burden limit medical therapy; decortication with anti‑TB therapy is often needed; VATS is feasible in selected cases.

10. Lung transplant recipient with early pleural space infection—most appropriate principle?
A. Liberal use of intrapleural tPA at full dose.
B. Early aggressive drainage; cautious escalation with limited IET due to anastomotic concerns.
C. Avoid surgery at all costs.
D. No role for tunneled catheters.
E. Prefer open thoracotomy up front.
Answer: B. Early source control is critical; IET is used sparingly given airway/vascular anastomoses; decortication is performed cautiously, and tunneled catheters may facilitate gradual expansion.

11. Regarding imaging, which is correct?
A. Chest X‑ray reliably detects effusions <50 mL.
B. Ultrasound is superior to CT at demonstrating septations and guides safe access.
C. CT is not useful in escalation decisions.
D. Ultrasound cannot identify locules.
E. Imaging is optional if pH is low.
Answer: B. TUS detects septations and locules and guides interventions; CT helps delineate anatomy and is used before escalation.

12. Which IET practice is evidence‑consistent?
A. DNase alone if bleeding risk is high.
B. tPA 10 mg + DNase 5 mg, BID, clamp 1 hour; consider tPA 5 mg if anticoagulation cannot be paused.
C. Routine 7‑day IET.
D. Streptokinase plus DNase preferred.
E. Start IET only after 7 days of tube drainage.
Answer: B. Combination therapy is recommended with standard dosing; reduced‑dose tPA is acceptable in high bleeding risk. Monotherapy and streptokinase are discouraged.

Controversies, Variability, and Evolving Evidence

Up‑front VATS vs initial tube drainage/IET: Evidence is limited by small trials and retrospective bias; consensus favors small‑bore tube first in stable adults, with early surgery for unstable patients or organized disease. Feasibility trials comparing early VATS with IET suggest equipoise; definitive studies are ongoing.

Antibiotic duration: Traditional ~4‑week courses are common; emerging trials suggest shorter durations may be reasonable after adequate source control, but evidence remains underpowered.

Pleural irrigation: Pilot data support radiographic improvement and fewer surgical referrals, but mortality benefit is unproven and larger trials are needed.

Medical thoracoscopy: Early data show shorter post‑procedure stays vs IET in small RCTs; larger studies are required before routine adoption.

Take‑Home Checklist

Confirm effusion with TUS; plan the safest access point.

Measure pH immediately at first tap; convert to tube if pH <=7.20 or if purulent/+Gram/+culture.

Use <=14F image‑guided tubes; flush regularly.

Start appropriate empiric antibiotics without waiting for cultures; tailor promptly.

Reassess at ~48 h using clinical status, inflammatory markers, and CT if needed.

In stable stage 2 disease with residual collection, use tPA 10 mg + DNase 5 mg BID (consider tPA 5 mg if bleeding risk).

If IET contraindicated, consider saline irrigation.

Call surgery early for unstable patients, organized stage 3/rind, or IET failure; VATS preferred when possible.

Apply RAPID score at baseline to frame risk and intensity of care.

Plan follow‑up at 2-4 weeks and 8-12 weeks; focus on clinical recovery over complete radiographic resolution alone.
