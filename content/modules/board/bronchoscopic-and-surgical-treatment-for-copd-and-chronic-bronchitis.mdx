Bronchoscopic and Surgical Treatment for COPD and Chronic Bronchitis
Exam Mapping & Scope

This chapter covers interventional approaches to advanced COPD—including emphysema‐predominant and chronic bronchitis phenotypes—with emphasis on bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR), lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS), peri‑procedural management, complication recognition/management, and selection algorithms. It maps to AABIP blueprint domains: patient selection, imaging and physiology, therapeutic bronchoscopy, anesthesia/sedation, complications, and post‑procedure follow‑up.

Learning Objectives

Identify candidates and contraindications for BLVR versus LVRS using physiologic, radiographic, and clinical criteria.

Apply a stepwise algorithm to evaluate fissure integrity and collateral ventilation and to choose the target lobe.

Execute a reproducible procedural checklist for EBV/IBV placement and peri‑procedural anesthesia strategies that mitigate pneumothorax risk.

Diagnose and manage common complications—especially pneumothorax—using evidence‑based pathways.

Counsel patients with special conditions (very low FEV₁/DLCO, pulmonary hypertension, alpha‑1 antitrypsin deficiency, transplant candidacy) about risks, benefits, and sequencing with surgery.

Recognize emerging bronchoscopic therapies for chronic bronchitis (e.g., cryospray, targeted lung denervation) and their current evidence status.

Demonstrate exam‑level proficiency with high‑yield trials (NETT, VENT, STELVIO, TRANSFORM, LIBERATE, EMPROVE) and what they mean for practice.

High‑Yield One‑Pager

Mechanism: Lobar occlusion → target lobe atelectasis → reduced static/dynamic hyperinflation → improved elastic recoil, diaphragm curvature, V/Q matching, and cardiac preload.

Valves: Zephyr® EBV (duckbill) and Spiration® IBV (umbrella); both are one‑way valves allowing egress of air/secretions; multiple sizes; removable.

Selection (typical BLVR window): FEV₁ about 20–50% predicted; marked hyperinflation (e.g., RV ≥175% predicted; ≥200% if homogeneous); RV/TLC elevated; suitable target lobe with absent interlobar collateral ventilation and adequate fissure integrity.

Collateral Ventilation (CV): Assess with high‑resolution CT fissure analysis and/or Chartis® catheter; both are imperfect—use complementary approach.

Trial signals: In CV‑negative severe emphysema, valves improve FEV₁, symptoms (SGRQ), and 6MWD in RCTs; pneumothorax is the dominant early adverse event.

LVRS: Benefits select patients (upper‑lobe–predominant emphysema, low baseline exercise capacity) with improvements in symptoms and exercise; higher perioperative risk than BLVR.

Pneumothorax facts: Typically occurs within 72 h post‑valve; risk higher with upper‑lobe targets and very complete fissures; stable patients generally receive tube thoracostomy without suction initially; valve removal reserved for persistent leak/instability.

Anesthesia pearl: Low inspired oxygen strategy (keep SpO₂ ≥ 89% using the lowest feasible FiO₂ and wait for end‑tidal O₂ equilibration) is associated with lower pneumothorax rates.

Post‑op COPD exacerbations: Prophylaxis (antibiotics ± steroids) lowers early AECOPD; many centers favor antibiotics alone.

Referral reality: Only a minority of referred patients are ultimately eligible for BLVR; most common disqualifiers include no suitable target lobe, chronic bronchitis–predominant phenotype with frequent exacerbations, and insufficient hyperinflation.

Special populations: Very low FEV₁ (&lt;20%) or DLCO (&lt;20%) can still benefit in experienced centers; pulmonary hypertension data are limited but early feasibility is encouraging.

Bridging strategy: BLVR can bridge to transplant or LVRS; sequential/bilateral BLVR may restore lost benefit in selected patients.

Chronic bronchitis therapies: Airway cryospray (liquid nitrogen) aims to remodel mucosa; targeted lung denervation ablates parasympathetic input—both promising but investigational for routine boards‑level decisions.

Core Concepts
Pathophysiology / Epidemiology

Advanced emphysema produces alveolar destruction, loss of elastic recoil, and hyperinflation that flattens the diaphragm and worsens expiratory flow limitation. Hyperinflation also reduces venous return and cardiac chamber volumes; volume reduction improves mechanics and can augment cardiac preload and output. Chronic bronchitis features mucous gland hyperplasia and goblet cell prominence driving cough, sputum, and exacerbations; it is generally not the ideal phenotype for valve‑based BLVR, prompting development of bronchoscopic airway‑directed therapies.

Indications & Contraindications

BLVR—Typical Indications

Severe COPD with symptomatic hyperinflation despite optimal inhaled therapy, oxygen (as needed), and pulmonary rehabilitation.

Suitable target lobe with evident destruction and low perfusion.

Fissure integrity sufficient to suggest absent interlobar CV (confirmed if needed with Chartis).

Physiologic impairment within studied ranges (e.g., FEV₁ ~20–50% pred; RV elevated).

BLVR—Common Contraindications / Reasons for Ineligibility (selected, with typical frequencies among referrals)

No suitable target lobe (~18%).

Unsuitable phenotype (chronic bronchitis with frequent exacerbations, asthma) (~18%).

Insufficient hyperinflation (~16%).

Homogeneous emphysema without clear target (~10%).

Incomplete fissures (~9%).

Current smoking, lack of pulmonary rehab completion, high anticoagulation needs, large bullae, very fragile condition, suspicious nodules, or severe comorbidity (each small percentages).

LVRS—Key Selection Principles (NETT)

Bilateral emphysema with marked hyperinflation; exclude high‑risk group (FEV₁ ≤20% with homogeneous emphysema or DLCO ≤20%).

Greatest benefit: upper‑lobe–predominant emphysema with low baseline exercise tolerance.

Higher perioperative morbidity/mortality than BLVR; careful center selection is crucial.

Pre‑procedure Evaluation

Pulmonary physiology: Spirometry, plethysmography (RV/TLC), DLCO, 6MWD; confirm recent pulmonary rehab.

Imaging: Thin‑slice HRCT with lobar emphysema quantification and fissure analysis; note distribution (heterogeneous vs homogeneous), bullae, paraseptal disease, pleural adhesions, nodules.

CV assessment: Quantitative fissure analysis (platform‑dependent thresholds) and/or in‑procedure Chartis.

Perfusion: Nuclear perfusion may help adjudicate target lobe when anatomy is equivocal.

Comorbidities: Cardiac risk, pulmonary hypertension, OSA, osteoporosis, prior thoracic surgery, anticoagulation; optimize before intervention.

Smoking status: Abstinence required (commonly ≥4–6 mo).

Consent: Discuss benefits vs pneumothorax risk, potential need for revision bronchoscopy or valve removal, hospital observation.

Equipment & Setup

Bronchoscope: Working channel ≥2.6 mm.

Valves:

Spiration® IBV: Umbrella design; nitinol frame with distal anchors; polyurethane membrane; sizes 5, 6, 7, 9 mm; sized with dedicated balloon/calibration kit.

Zephyr® EBV: Duckbill silicone valve on nitinol retainer; sizes 4.0, 4.0‑LP, 5.5, 5.5‑LP; sized with depth/diameter catheter (straight or J).

Chartis® system: Balloon catheter and console for functional CV testing.

Ancillaries: Valve loader/delivery catheters, fluoroscopy (optional), airway sizing tools, standard bronchoscopy accessories.

Anesthesia: General anesthesia (ETT or LMA) or monitored anesthesia care with topicalization; many centers favor ETT plus total IV anesthesia for stability. Low‑FiO₂ protocol: maintain SpO₂ ≥ 89% using lowest viable FiO₂; delay valve deployment until exhaled O₂ approximates inspired O₂.

Step‑by‑Step Technique / Procedural Checklist

Final plan review: Confirm target lobe, fissure status, and anesthesia plan; ensure antibiotics prophylaxis strategy if used.

Airway access: Secure airway; apply low‑FiO₂ strategy and low respiratory rate with prolonged expiratory time (e.g., I:E 1:3–1:4).

Chartis (if needed): Isolate target lobar bronchus; verify CV‑negative flow/volume pattern (recognize low‑flow/collapse phenomenon).

Airway mapping & sizing: Sequentially size segmental/subsegmental bronchi.

Valve deployment: Place most proximal valve last; confirm position and occlusion; reassess airflow and ensure egress of secretions.

Hemostasis & toilet: Suction secretions; minimize suction pressure at treated lobe.

Immediate post‑procedure CXR and structured observation (typically inpatient 2–3 days) with serial CXRs and symptom checks.

Discharge plan: Education about pneumothorax symptoms; 24/7 contact; follow‑up imaging and PFT plans.

Troubleshooting & Intra‑procedure Management

No target lobe or equivocal heterogeneity: Consider perfusion imaging; if homogeneous disease, strict hyperinflation thresholds matter; LVRS or non‑valve bronchoscopic options may be preferable.

Chartis indeterminate: Reposition balloon, optimize ventilation (reduce RR, prolong expiration), and confirm seal; correlate with CT fissure score.

Valve migration or incomplete occlusion: Upsize valve or add subsegmental valves; ensure correct orientation and full expansion.

Hypoxemia during deployment: Briefly increase FiO₂; correct quickly to low‑FiO₂ once stable.

Post‑procedure Care & Follow‑up

Monitoring: Highest pneumothorax risk within 72 h; low threshold for repeat CXR if dyspnea/pleurisy.

AECOPD prophylaxis: Center‑specific; antibiotic prophylaxis alone is associated with the lowest early AECOPD rates in retrospective cohorts.

Rehabilitation: Resume/continue pulmonary rehab after discharge.

Revision bronchoscopy: Consider if no meaningful clinical/radiographic response by 6–12 weeks or if benefit wanes; common reasons include granulation tissue, migration, or unrecognized CV.

Complications (Prevention, Recognition, Management)

Pneumothorax

Risk enhancers: Upper‑lobe targets (especially left upper lobe), very complete fissures, large/hyperinflated target lobe; immediate rapid atelectasis; pleural adhesions; bullous/paraseptal emphysema.

Timing: Most occur day 0–3; later events possible with revisions or staged completion.

Initial management (stable patient): Tube thoracostomy without suction; observe.

Persistent leak (>~72 h) or incomplete expansion: Apply suction, remove 1–2 valves; CT to identify culprit segment; consider Heimlich valve for discharge.

Unstable/large air leak: Early valve removal (partial or complete) and definitive air leak management; surgical repair in refractory cases.

Reimplantation after removal: Possible but carries substantial recurrence risk; discuss carefully.

Other Complications

AECOPD (reduced with prophylaxis); post‑obstructive pneumonia; hemoptysis; valve migration or granulation tissue requiring revision; rare death in context of severe pneumothorax or comorbidity.

Special Populations

Very low FEV₁ (&lt;20%) or DLCO (&lt;20%): Small series show feasibility and clinically meaningful improvements with similar pneumothorax rates; counsel about higher fragility and prolonged leaks.

Pulmonary hypertension (Group 3): Limited feasibility data suggest improvements in hemodynamics/6MWD without PH‑specific complications in carefully selected patients.

Alpha‑1 antitrypsin deficiency: No longer an automatic exclusion if other criteria are favorable.

Bridging strategies: BLVR can delay the need for transplant; does not appear to worsen post‑transplant outcomes; LVRS after failed BLVR is feasible in rescue settings.

Staged/Sequential BLVR: Two‑stage lobar completion may reduce pneumothorax risk while preserving efficacy.

Bilateral repeat BLVR: Can recapture benefits after early decline in selected patients.

Evidence & Outcomes (Key Trials/Signals)

LVRS (NETT): After excluding the high‑risk subgroup, LVRS improved exercise capacity and quality of life; benefits strongest in upper‑lobe–predominant disease with low exercise capacity; perioperative risk remained significant (e.g., ~8% 90‑day mortality vs ~1% with medical therapy; high complication rates).

Early valves (VENT): Modest average benefit overall; signal concentrated in patients with complete fissures.

Modern EBV RCTs (STELVIO, TRANSFORM, LIBERATE): In CV‑negative heterogeneous emphysema, clinically meaningful improvements in FEV₁, 6MWD, and SGRQ; pneumothorax ≈ 18–30% within first 45 days (study‑dependent).

IBV RCT (EMPROVE): Improvements in FEV₁ and health status; TLVR achieved in most treated lobes; 6MWD signal smaller; sustained benefits out to 24 months with low late pneumothorax rates.

Cardiac/hemodynamics: Post‑BLVR increases in cardiac preload/output without raising pulmonary artery pressures.

Exacerbations & survival: AECOPD frequency decreases (largest reduction with complete lobar atelectasis); selection for BLVR and achievement of lobar collapse associate with longer survival.

Parallel bullets (Algorithm 1)

Confirm symptom burden despite optimized inhaled therapy, oxygen, and rehab.

Use HRCT to localize a damaged, low‑perfusion lobe; quantify fissure integrity.

Ensure hyperinflation and functional reserve within studied windows.

If fissures adequate, confirm CV‑negative status (Chartis if needed).

Proceed to BLVR if target lobe, physiology, and CV status align; otherwise pivot to LVRS (if NETT‑favorable) or investigational bronchoscopic options for chronic bronchitis.

Parallel bullets (Algorithm 2)

Most events occur within 72 h; keep low threshold for imaging.

Initial chest drainage without suction in stable patients; escalate only if needed.

Early valve removal for hemodynamic compromise or refractory leak; recognize that re‑implantation carries meaningful recurrence risk.

Educate patients on symptoms and ensure rapid re‑access to care.

Cases & Applied Learning

Case 1
A 64‑year‑old former smoker with severe dyspnea despite triple inhalers and rehab: FEV₁ 28% pred, RV 235% pred, DLCO 32% pred, 6MWD 260 m. HRCT shows heterogeneous emphysema with nearly complete left major fissure. What is the next best step?
Answer: Proceed with functional assessment of CV (Chartis) if any doubt remains about fissure integrity; if CV‑negative, plan EBV/IBV with low‑FiO₂ anesthesia strategy.
Explanation: Even with very complete fissures, a confirmatory functional test is reasonable when clinical risk–benefit hinges on success. Absence of CV predicts lobar collapse and clinical response.

Case 2
A 71‑year‑old with CV‑negative EBV to LUL develops acute pleuritic chest pain 18 h later. CXR: large left pneumothorax; vitals stable.
Answer: Insert chest tube to water seal (no suction initially), close observation, and reassess for expansion and air leak over 24–72 h.
Explanation: Most early post‑valve pneumothoraces can be managed with drainage without suction. Escalation (suction/valve removal) is reserved for persistent leak, poor expansion, or instability.

Case 3
A 58‑year‑old with homogeneous emphysema, RV 210% pred, fissures borderline, frequent exacerbations. Considering LVR pathway.
Answer: LVRS candidacy should be discussed if NETT‑favorable; valve‑based BLVR is less likely to succeed; consider investigational chronic bronchitis therapies if symptoms are cough/sputum‑predominant.
Explanation: Homogeneous disease and exacerbation‑prone chronic bronchitis phenotype are less suitable for EBV/IBV; LVRS may still benefit selected patients.

Question Bank (12 MCQs)

1. A 66‑year‑old with severe heterogeneous emphysema has left upper lobe destruction, RV 240% pred, and left major fissure visually ~90%. What optimizes response prediction before EBV?
A. Proceed directly—fissure is enough
B. Chartis assessment of the LUL
C. Perfusion scan only
D. Bronchial thermoplasty
E. Target the contralateral lung
Answer: B.
Explanation: When fissure completeness is not unequivocally very high, functional confirmation of absent CV with Chartis improves prediction of TLVR and response.

2. After EBV to the RUL, a patient’s day‑2 CXR shows a moderate pneumothorax. He is stable on room air. Best immediate management?
A. Observation only
B. Tube thoracostomy to water seal
C. Immediate suction at −20 cmH₂O
D. Remove all valves now
E. Administer high‑dose steroids only
Answer: B.
Explanation: Stable post‑EBV pneumothorax is initially managed with chest tube to water seal; suction and valve removal are reserved for refractory leak or instability.

3. Which intra‑operative strategy is associated with lower pneumothorax incidence after EBV?
A. 100% FiO₂ throughout
B. High respiratory rate with short expiratory time
C. Low FiO₂ targeting SpO₂ ≥ 89% and waiting for end‑tidal O₂ equilibration before deployment
D. Positive end‑expiratory pressure of 15 cmH₂O
E. Intermittent apnea with recruitment maneuvers
Answer: C.
Explanation: A low‑FiO₂ protocol reduces nitrogen washout and rapid atelectasis, mitigating early pneumothorax risk.

4. A patient has EBV placed without TLVR at 8 weeks. CT shows well‑seated valves; fissure completeness underestimated initially. Next step?
A. Remove all valves—failure
B. Revision bronchoscopy to address granulation/malposition and reassess for occult CV
C. LVRS immediately
D. Begin long‑term macrolide therapy
E. Observe for 1 year
Answer: B.
Explanation: Loss or lack of effect often reflects malposition, incomplete occlusion, or granulation; revision bronchoscopy frequently restores benefit.

5. Which NETT subgroup derived the clearest overall benefit from LVRS?
A. Homogeneous emphysema with high exercise capacity
B. Upper‑lobe–predominant emphysema with low exercise capacity
C. Lower‑lobe–predominant emphysema with high exercise capacity
D. FEV₁ ≤20% and DLCO ≤20%
E. Any emphysema pattern with high DLCO
Answer: B.
Explanation: NETT demonstrated reduced mortality and improved function in upper‑lobe–predominant disease with low baseline exercise tolerance.

6. A 63‑year‑old with emphysema and DLCO 18% asks about BLVR risk. Which is most accurate?
A. Absolute contraindication—no data
B. Feasible in experienced centers with meaningful improvements; pneumothorax risk similar but leaks may persist longer
C. Only LVRS is safe
D. BLVR benefits are limited to DLCO >60%
E. BLVR invariably worsens gas exchange
Answer: B.
Explanation: Small cohorts show safety/efficacy in very low DLCO when carefully selected, though prolonged air leaks are more common.

7. For a chronic bronchitis‑predominant COPD patient with frequent exacerbations and minimal hyperinflation, which bronchoscopic option is most aligned with pathophysiology?
A. EBV to the most destroyed lobe
B. IBV to both lower lobes
C. Airway cryospray therapy
D. LVRS
E. Endobronchial coils
Answer: C.
Explanation: Airway cryospray targets mucosal remodeling for chronic bronchitis; valve‑based BLVR suits emphysema with hyperinflation.

8. Which statement about valve re‑implantation after removal for pneumothorax is correct?
A. It eliminates recurrence risk
B. Recurrence risk can be substantial and should be discussed before attempting re‑implantation
C. It must be done within 48 hours
D. It is contraindicated if the initial leak resolved
E. It requires contralateral targeting
Answer: B.
Explanation: Recurrence after re‑implantation is meaningfully frequent; timing and candidacy are individualized.

9. A candidate has RV 150% pred, FEV₁ 40% pred, and heterogeneous emphysema. Why is BLVR less likely to help?
A. RV too high
B. RV too low (hyperinflation insufficient)
C. FEV₁ too low
D. Heterogeneity precludes benefit
E. Need pulmonary rehab first
Answer: B.
Explanation: Insufficient static hyperinflation is a common reason for ineligibility and predicts limited mechanical gain.

10. Which prophylactic approach is most associated with fewer early AECOPD events after BLVR in retrospective series?
A. Steroids alone
B. No prophylaxis
C. Antibiotics alone
D. Dual antiplatelet therapy
E. Inhaled hypertonic saline
Answer: C.
Explanation: Antibiotic‑only prophylaxis was associated with the lowest early exacerbation rates compared with other strategies.

11. Which device‑to‑feature pairing is correct?
A. Zephyr—umbrella membrane with 5 anchors
B. Spiration—duckbill silicone valve
C. Spiration—balloon‑based sizing kit (5–9 mm valves)
D. Zephyr—cannot be removed once placed
E. Either device—requires rigid bronchoscopy
Answer: C.
Explanation: Spiration uses balloon/calibration sizing and offers 5–9 mm; Zephyr uses depth/diameter catheter; both are removable via flexible bronchoscopy.

12. A 70‑year‑old with LUL EBV develops a large, symptomatic pneumothorax with persistent air leak after 72 h of drainage and suction. Best next step?
A. Discharge with observation
B. Begin antibiotics only
C. Remove 1–2 valves and reassess; consider full removal if leak persists
D. Immediate LVRS
E. Place IBV in adjacent lobes
Answer: C.
Explanation: Persistent leak warrants valve removal (partial first) and targeted management; aggressive surgery is reserved for selected refractory cases.

Controversies, Variability, and Evolving Evidence

CV testing: Quantitative CT vs Chartis—neither is perfect; combining methods reduces misclassification.

Fissure thresholds: Platforms differ in percent cutoffs; clinical judgment and functional testing are key.

Homogeneous disease: Benefits are smaller and require stricter hyperinflation criteria.

Anesthesia: Low‑FiO₂ strategies are increasingly adopted but not universal.

Prophylaxis: Antibiotic vs steroid regimens vary by center; evidence derives largely from retrospective analyses.

Severe pneumothorax: Prediction is improving; left upper lobe targeting and large target lobes increase risk; re‑implantation carries notable recurrence risk.

Chronic bronchitis therapies: Cryospray and targeted lung denervation show promise but remain in evolution for routine practice.

Take‑Home Checklist

Confirm symptomatic hyperinflation and completion of pulmonary rehab before LVR.

Use HRCT to map emphysema and fissures; add Chartis if fissures are not unequivocally complete.

Prioritize absent CV and a clearly targetable lobe for valves.

Plan low‑FiO₂ anesthesia and deliberate ventilator settings to reduce pneumothorax risk.

Observe in hospital 2–3 days post‑valve; most pneumothoraces occur by day 3.

Manage stable pneumothorax with tube to water seal first; escalate stepwise.

Schedule revision bronchoscopy if there is no benefit at 6–12 weeks or if response wanes.

Consider staged completion or bilateral BLVR in selected patients; discuss bridging to transplant/LVRS.

In homogeneous or bronchitis‑predominant disease, re‑evaluate the pathway (LVRS or investigational airway therapies).

Provide realistic counseling: not all referred patients are eligible; discuss risks, re‑interventions, and expected magnitude of benefit.
