Lung Cancer Staging and Linear EBUS

Target audience: IP fellows and practicing pulmonologists

Exam Mapping & Scope

This chapter integrates the 9th edition TNM stage classification with practical, exam‑relevant application of linear endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) for mediastinal staging. It emphasizes imaging triage (CT, PET/CT, brain MRI when appropriate), nodal maps and boundaries, indications for invasive staging, systematic vs targeted EBUS strategies, sample acquisition/processing, complication recognition, and post‑test decision‑making (including when—if ever—to confirm a negative EBUS with mediastinoscopy).

Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, the reader will be able to:

Apply 9th edition TNM updates—N2a vs N2b and M1c1 vs M1c2—to clinical staging decisions.

Identify which mediastinal/hilar nodal stations are accessible by EBUS vs EUS‑B and recognize high‑risk anatomic boundaries.

Select patients for invasive mediastinal staging and choose between systematic and targeted EBUS strategies.

Execute a stepwise, contamination‑minimizing EBUS‑TBNA workflow, including sampling order (N3→N2→N1) and adequate passes.

Optimize sedation/oxygenation and troubleshoot poor windows, calcified or necrotic nodes, and bleeding.

Interpret negative invasive staging in context and plan when additional mediastinoscopy changes management.

High‑Yield One‑Pager (Pearls, Pitfalls, Traps)

TNM‑9 essentials: N2 subdivides into single‑station (N2a) vs multistation (N2b); M1c subdivides into single‑organ (M1c1) vs multi‑organ (M1c2). Several T/N combinations shift stage groups (notably T1N2aM0 → Stage IIB).

Measure the solid/invasive component for T size; lepidic/ground‑glass portions do not count toward T size; STAS does not change T.

Node map boundaries matter: e.g., lower rim of the azygos distinguishes 4R from 10R; the superior rim of the aortic arch separates 2L from 4L. Mislabeling can upstage or downstage.

Imaging triage: PET/CT outperforms CT for mediastinal nodes but has false positives; no PET/CT for small brain mets—use brain MRI when clinically indicated.

Who needs invasive staging? Discrete mediastinal adenopathy, PET‑avid mediastinal nodes; “intermediate risk” scenarios include central tumors, tumors >3 cm, or cN1—despite normal CT/PET mediastinum.

EBUS vs surgery: Endoscopic needle staging (EBUS/EUS‑B) has high sensitivity/specificity and is the preferred first test; combining EBUS+EUS increases yield.

Systematic > targeted (often): A systematic approach (sampling ≥3 stations, typically 4R, 4L, 7) detects additional N2/N3 disease compared with “hit‑and‑run.”

Sampling order is an exam favorite: Always from N3 → N2 → N1 to avoid contamination.

Adequacy: ≥3 passes per target is a common adequacy benchmark; consider additional passes for molecular testing or when ROSE is unavailable.

Stations 5–6 caveat: Rarely accessible by EBUS; consider EUS‑B or surgical approaches when these are critical.

Complications are uncommon: Major events are rare; pneumothorax is unusual but can occur near pleura (e.g., right paratracheal close to pleural reflection).

Negative EBUS—then what? Confirmatory mediastinoscopy after a high‑quality, systematic negative EBUS yields limited incremental benefit in many settings; consider patient selection and institutional protocols.

Sedation: Moderate and deep sedation both acceptable; deep sedation may reduce intraprocedural instability in some cohorts; HFNC can mitigate desaturation under moderate sedation.

Special situations: Limited utility of EBUS‑TBNA for classic Hodgkin lymphoma; cryobiopsy or surgical tissue may be needed.

Report like a surgeon: Specify stations sampled, needle gauge, passes, use of ROSE, and any limitations (calcification, necrosis, vascular proximity).

Core Concepts
Pathophysiology / Epidemiology (brief)

Nodal spread follows predictable drainage from lobar to mediastinal stations, with prognosis tied not just to presence of nodal disease but also distribution (single vs multistation) and extent (ipsilateral vs contralateral). TNM‑9 formalizes this clinically observed gradient by splitting N2 and M1c.

Indications & Contraindications

Indications for invasive mediastinal staging (needle-based preferred first test):

Discrete mediastinal lymph node enlargement (short axis >1 cm) and/or FDG‑avid mediastinal nodes with no distant metastases.

“Intermediate risk” with radiographically normal mediastinum but high‑risk primary: central tumor, tumor >3 cm, or suspected N1 on imaging.

Select PET‑negative primaries (low SUV) where occult N2/N3 risk remains.

When invasive staging is generally not indicated:

Peripheral tumor &lt;3 cm with avid primary and no suspicious nodes on CT/PET.

EBUS/EUS‑B station selection:

EBUS reaches most stations except 5–6 (aortopulmonary and para‑aortic).

EUS‑B adds excellent access to stations 8–9 and augments access to 4L, 7; left adrenal is often assessable during the same session if clinically relevant.

Contraindications and precautions:

Uncontrolled coagulopathy or high bleeding risk; temporarily pause therapeutic anticoagulation when safe.

For EUS‑B, esophageal varices/severe dysphagia increase risk.

Pre‑procedure Evaluation

Imaging: Chest CT (thin sections); PET/CT to screen for distant disease and prioritize stations; consider brain MRI case‑by‑case (e.g., neurologic symptoms or when curative therapy is planned).

Labs and meds: Review platelet count/coagulation and antithrombotics with plan for holding/resumption per local protocol.

Airway & anesthesia plan: Moderate sedation vs deep sedation/GA. GA facilitates stability, suppresses cough, and allows repeated scope exchanges (ETT ≥8.0, LMA, or rigid support). For moderate sedation, HFNC reduces desaturation versus low‑flow.

Consent: Document potential benefits (minimally invasive staging, molecular adequacy) and rare but serious risks (significant bleeding, pneumothorax, mediastinitis).

Equipment & Setup

Scope: Linear (curvilinear) echo‑bronchoscope with ~7.5‑MHz transducer; outer diameter ≈6.3–6.6 mm. Balloon sheath for coupling (inflate with saline).

Needles: 19G, 21G, 22G, 25G; typical excursion depth ~5–40 mm with adjustable safety lock.

Ancillaries: Doppler, suction, syringes for vacuum (or capillary technique), ROSE when available, media for cell block/core, HFNC or ventilatory support per sedation plan.

Layout and safety: Sterile field, bite block/mouthpiece, crash‑cart readiness, and ultrasound machine positioned so operator can simultaneously see endoscopic and US views.

Step‑by‑Step Technique / Procedural Checklist

Airway access (mouth/LMA/ETT/rigid) and topicalization per plan; couple balloon for ultrasound contact.

Survey airway; align on CT/PET roadmap; confirm vascular landmarks on US (e.g., SVC and azygos for 4R; left PA and aortic arch for 4L).

Systematic evaluation and sampling order: contralateral mediastinal (N3) → ipsilateral mediastinal (N2) → hilar (N1).

Targeting & safety: Activate Doppler to avoid vessels; respect pleura near right paratracheal/azygos region; differentiate esophagus posteriorly at 7.

Needle handling (jab method): Lock body, advance sheath to visual field, release lock, quick jab into node under real‑time US, stylet manipulation, apply suction, 3–10 to‑and‑fro motions, release suction, retract and recover sample.

Passes: Perform ≥3 passes per station for cytology; add more if molecular testing anticipated or ROSE inadequate.

Sample processing: Prepare smears + cell block (or clot core) for histology and ancillary studies; label by station.

Combine with EUS‑B (same session) if posterior/inferior stations or left adrenal are indicated.

Completion: Rinse scope, reinflate balloon as needed, confirm hemostasis, and perform brief airway inspection.

Troubleshooting & Intra‑procedure Management

Poor contact: Refill balloon, adjust flexion, change patient neck position, or use small scope tip deflections to optimize the window.

Calcified or fibrotic nodes: Use a stiffer needle (e.g., 19–21G) and multiple redirections within node; consider additional passes for cell block.

Necrotic nodes: Sample the viable peripheral rim on US; Doppler to avoid feeding vessels.

Bleeding: Most events are minor; apply suction, cold saline; if persistent, withdraw and reassess coagulation status; consider tamponade with the scope/balloon.

Cough/movement: Deepen sedation or convert to GA; LMA/ETT often improves precision and throughput.

Station identification errors: Re‑interrogate landmarks (azygos arch = inferior 4R border; superior LPA = inferior 4L border; esophagus posterior at 7); misclassification can change N category.

Post‑procedure Care & Follow‑up

Monitor 1–2 hours for hypoxemia or bleeding.

Resume antithrombotics per protocol; give return precautions (fever, chest pain, hemoptysis).

Reporting essentials: Clinical context, imaging summary, stations evaluated and sampled, gauge and passes, ROSE result (if used), immediate complications/limitations, and next steps (e.g., need for additional staging at stations 5–6).

Complications (prevention, recognition, management)

Overall risk is low. Reported major adverse events are rare (well under 2% in most series). Minor complications include cough, transient hypoxemia, and mild bleeding.

Pneumothorax: Uncommon (reported well under 1%); risk increases when pleura is close (e.g., high right paratracheal). Always keep pleura in view while sampling.

Infectious: Mediastinitis is rare; sterile technique and avoiding traversing contaminated fields reduce risk; consider antibiotic prophylaxis selectively (e.g., cystic lesions, high‑risk hosts).

Sedation‑related: Hypoventilation, hypotension, arrhythmia—optimize preoxygenation; HFNC reduces desaturation in moderate sedation; deep sedation/GA can reduce intra‑procedure instability in some cohorts.

Special Populations

cN0 by imaging but “intermediate risk”: Central tumors, >3 cm, or cN1—systematic EBUS/EUS‑B is appropriate; occult N2/N3 disease is not rare.

Left upper lobe tumors with suspicious aortopulmonary window nodes: Consider EUS‑B or surgical access to stations 5–6.

Lymphoma: Classic Hodgkin lymphoma can be challenging by TBNA; consider adjunctive cryobiopsy or alternate approach for architecture.

Radiation planning: Pre‑treatment EBUS/EUS‑B improves target delineation when nodal status is uncertain.

Antithrombotics/pregnancy/ICU: Individualize with anesthesia support; prioritize oxygenation and fetal considerations where applicable; invasive staging remains feasible with GA and controlled ventilation.

Evidence & Outcomes (selected)

Imaging performance: PET/CT mediastinal nodal sensitivity/specificity commonly reported around ~77–85%/86–90%; CT alone often ~55–61%/79–81%. PET/CT can be false‑positive (inflammation/infection) and false‑negative in low‑FDG histologies; brain MRI outperforms PET/CT for small brain mets.

Endoscopic needle staging: EBUS‑TBNA shows high sensitivity (~90%) and near‑perfect specificity in experienced hands; combining EBUS+EUS modestly increases staging sensitivity (into the low‑ to mid‑90% range).

Systematic vs targeted: Systematic endosonographic staging (sampling ≥3 stations) detects additional N2/N3 disease compared with targeted “suspicious‑only” approaches.

After a negative, high‑quality EBUS: Routine confirmatory mediastinoscopy adds little for many patients and may delay therapy and increase morbidity; reserve for select high‑risk scenarios or discordant cases after multidisciplinary review.

Confirm station boundaries (e.g., azygos = inferior 4R; superior LPA = inferior 4L).

Use Doppler before puncture; avoid pleura near high right paratracheal.

Redirect within node to avoid necrotic core; rim sampling often better.

Document stations sampled, gauge/passes, and any limitations.

Cases & Applied Learning

Case 1 (Next best step).
A 5‑cm left lower lobe NSCLC is PET‑avid; mild uptake in 4L, 7, and 11R; no distant metastases.
A. Proceed directly to lobectomy
B. Start sampling at 11R
C. Start sampling at 4L
D. PET alone is adequate
E. Routine mediastinoscopy first
Answer: B. Start at N3 first (contralateral hilar 11R), then N2 (4L/7), then N1. EBUS‑TBNA is the preferred initial modality; PET alone is insufficient to finalize mediastinal staging.

Case 2 (Access planning).
A left upper lobe tumor with suspected aortopulmonary window involvement on PET/CT.
A. EBUS of 5–6
B. EUS‑B or surgical approach to 5–6
C. Skip staging and operate
D. Sample only 7
E. Target adrenal first
Answer: B. Stations 5–6 are rarely accessible by EBUS; EUS‑B or a surgical approach is indicated when these stations drive management.

Case 3 (Negative EBUS).
A patient with central T2 tumor and cN0 by CT/PET undergoes systematic EBUS/EUS‑B (≥3 stations, adequate passes) that is negative.
A. Always proceed to confirmatory mediastinoscopy
B. Proceed with resection/RT per plan
C. Treat as N2b
D. Repeat EBUS immediately
E. Start chemotherapy
Answer: B. High‑quality negative endosonography often obviates routine confirmatory mediastinoscopy; consider confirmation selectively (discordance/high residual risk).

Question Bank (MCQs)

1. A 3.5‑cm central RUL mass with normal mediastinum on CT/PET. Best next step for mediastinal evaluation?
A. PET/CT repeat in 3 months
B. EBUS‑TBNA (systematic)
C. Direct to lobectomy
D. Chest MRI
E. Bone scan
Answer: B. Central tumors >3 cm are “intermediate risk” despite normal imaging and warrant invasive mediastinal staging.

2. During EBUS of 4R, which landmark best defines the inferior border of 4R and helps distinguish it from 10R?
A. Left pulmonary artery
B. Aortic arch
C. Azygos vein (lower rim)

E. Carina
Answer: C. The lower rim of the azygos marks the inferior border of 4R; below this is 10R.

3. In TNM‑9, which change is correct?
A. M1a subdivided into M1a1/M1a2
B. N2 subdivided into N2a (single station) and N2b (multistation)
C. T categories now count lepidic component
D. STAS increases T category
E. VPI no longer affects T
Answer: B. N2 is now split into N2a and N2b; lepidic isn’t counted in T size; STAS does not change T; VPI retains impact.

4. Which station is not typically reachable with linear EBUS and often requires EUS‑B or surgery?
A. 4L
B. 7
C. 10L
D. 5

A. N1 → N2 → N3
B. N2 → N3 → N1
C. N3 → N2 → N1
D. Any order is acceptable
E. N2 only
Answer: C. Sample N3 → N2 → N1 to avoid contamination/upstaging.

6. Which is true regarding sedation for EBUS‑TBNA?
A. Deep sedation is contraindicated
B. Moderate and deep sedation are acceptable; deep sedation may reduce intraprocedural instability
C. Only general anesthesia yields diagnostic samples
D. HFNC worsens desaturation under moderate sedation
E. ROSE is mandatory under deep sedation
Answer: B. Both strategies are acceptable; deep sedation/GA can stabilize the procedure; HFNC decreases desaturation risk during moderate sedation.

7. A posterior subcarinal node is difficult to visualize by EBUS. Best complementary strategy?
A. Higher suction only
B. Switch to EUS‑B for posterior view
C. Reduce balloon coupling
D. Sample N1 first
E. Abort procedure
Answer: B. EUS‑B often improves visualization and access to posterior subcarinal nodes.

A. One pass per node is sufficient
B. Two passes per node with no cell block
C. ≥3 passes per node and ensure cell block/clot core
D. Forego nodal sampling; biopsy primary only
E. Use 25G only

B. Small peripheral tumor &lt;3 cm with negative mediastinum
C. Central tumor with otherwise normal mediastinum
D. Isolated adrenal metastasis on PET/CT
E. Post‑neoadjuvant restaging for known multistation N2
Answer: C. “Intermediate‑risk” (e.g., central tumor) benefits from systematic staging to detect occult N2/N3.

11. Which statement about PET/CT is correct?
A. It reliably detects small brain metastases
B. It is superior to CT for nodal staging but can be false‑positive with inflammation
C. It outperforms MRI for Pancoast tumor invasion
D. It is ideal for low‑FDG tumors
E. A negative PET/CT rules out mediastinal disease definitively
Answer: B. PET/CT has better nodal performance than CT but limited brain sensitivity and false positives.

12. During 4R sampling, you encounter a hyperechoic center with anechoic peripheral vessels. Best next step?
A. Sample the hyperechoic center only
B. Use Doppler and redirect to viable rim, avoiding vessels
C. Increase suction and continue
D. Abort staging
E. Switch immediately to mediastinoscopy
Answer: B. Avoid vascular structures; necrotic centers are low yield—sample viable peripheral rim.

Controversies, Variability, and Evolving Evidence

Confirmatory mediastinoscopy after negative endosonography: modern trials and meta‑analyses show small incremental detection (particularly single‑station N2) with trade‑offs in delay and morbidity; practices vary by center and risk tolerance.

“Single‑station N2” vs “zone” definitions across guidelines can differ, complicating resectability discussions; TNM‑9’s N2a/N2b recognizes prognostic separation but clinical thresholds remain multidisciplinary.

Sedation strategy: Evidence supports both moderate and deep sedation; institutional expertise, anesthesia availability, and patient comorbidities drive choice.

Adjunctive tissue acquisition: EBUS‑guided mediastinal cryobiopsy is emerging for situations where TBNA is insufficient, especially for diseases that need architecture or broader molecular profiling.

Take‑Home Checklist

Know TNM‑9: N2a vs N2b; M1c1 vs M1c2; T counts solid/invasive size.

Triage with CT + PET/CT; consider brain MRI selectively.

Invasive staging for radiographic mediastinal disease and “intermediate‑risk” primaries.

Prefer systematic EBUS±EUS‑B; N3 → N2 → N1; ≥3 passes per station.

Recognize landmarks (azygos for 4R/10R; aortic arch/LPA for 4L).

Avoid vessels with Doppler; respect pleura at high right paratracheal.

Combine EUS‑B for stations 7 (posterior), 8–9, and left adrenal.

Document a structured report with stations, passes, adequacy, and limitations.

Negative EBUS does not always require mediastinoscopy—decide case‑by‑case.

Plan for molecular adequacy (cell block/clot core).

Anticipate and manage rare complications promptly.
