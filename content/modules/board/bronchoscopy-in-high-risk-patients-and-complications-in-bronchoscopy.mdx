Target audience: Interventional pulmonology fellows and practicing pulmonologists
Delivery mode: Publication‑Ready Clean (no inline citations or source‑file mentions)

Exam Mapping & Scope

Mapped domains include: peri‑procedural risk assessment, sedation and monitoring, special populations (pregnancy and pulmonary hypertension), and recognition/management of bronchoscopy complications (bleeding, hypoxemia, arrhythmias, pneumothorax, fever/infection, bronchospasm).

Learning Objectives

Differentiate minor versus major bronchoscopy complications and quote realistic event rates for board questions.

Stratify bleeding risk by patient, procedure, hemostasis, and tissue factors; apply practical antithrombotic hold/restart windows.

Execute a stepwise algorithm for intra‑procedural bleeding control and know when to escalate to rigid bronchoscopy or embolization.

Prevent, detect, and treat hypoxemia, laryngospasm/bronchospasm, sedation‑related events, pneumothorax, and post‑bronchoscopy fever/infection.

Adapt practice for pregnancy and pulmonary hypertension (PH), including airway, hemodynamic, and medication considerations.

High‑Yield One‑Pager

Numbers to know

Overall complication rate ~1% across large bronchoscopy cohorts; mortality ~0.02%.

Bleeding overall ≈0.3-5%; “severe” bleeding is rare (~0.3%).

Pneumothorax risk ~0.1-0.8% overall; up to ~11% after forceps transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) and ~5% with interstitial lung disease (ILD) cryobiopsy.

Post‑bronchoscopy fever (PBF) after BAL: ~5-16%, usually a sterile cytokine response.

Pearls & pitfalls

Classify bleeding by the intervention required, not estimated volume.

Antithrombotics: Aspirin can usually be continued; clopidogrel increases bleeding risk for biopsies. EBUS‑TBNA under clopidogrel has not consistently shown excess bleeding.

Bleeding sequence: Keep the scope in; suction/visualize; lateralize bleeding lung down; cold saline; topical vasoconstrictor (epinephrine or tranexamic acid); balloon blockade; sealants/plugs; secure airway early; escalate to rigid bronchoscopy/embolization when indicated.

Hypoxemia mitigation: Continuous SpO₂; oxygen if SpO₂ falls >4% for >1 min or <90%. High‑flow nasal cannula (HFNC) reduces desaturation events during sedated bronchoscopy.

Sedation (conscious/moderate by bronchoscopists): midazolam 1-2 mg IV then 0.5-1 mg; fentanyl 25-50 µg IV titrated. Reversal: flumazenil 0.2 mg then 0.1 mg/min to 1 mg; naloxone start 0.04 mg, repeat q2-5 min (up to ~0.01 mg/kg).

Pregnancy: anticipate difficult airway; avoid the nasal route; wedge the right hip (left uterine displacement); minimize hypercarbia; lowest effective lidocaine dose; multidisciplinary planning.

Pulmonary hypertension: TBLB bleeding risk is not clearly increased, but hypoxemia and prolonged mechanical ventilation are more likely; avoid triggers of increased PVR (hypoxemia, hypercarbia, pain/anxiety) and maintain preload.

Core Concepts
Pathophysiology & Epidemiology

Complications range from minor (epistaxis, fever, mild arrhythmias, limited bleeding) to major (pneumonia, significant pneumothorax, respiratory failure, life‑threatening hemorrhage). Hypoxemia arises from airway caliber reduction by the scope, ventilation-perfusion mismatch with topical anesthetic/saline/BAL, transient atelectasis, and bronchoconstriction. Arrhythmias are usually benign and related to hypoxemia, vagal tone, or stimulant drugs; major tachyarrhythmias are uncommon.

In pregnancy, mucosal edema, glandular hyperplasia, and increased reflux elevate aspiration and airway difficulty risks. Hemodynamic adaptations (increased blood volume and cardiac output) and IVC compression later in gestation predispose to supine hypotension. In PH, decompensation is driven by increased PVR due to hypoxemia, hypercarbia, pain/anxiety, or reduced preload from induction vasodilation/blood loss.

Indications & Contraindications

Age alone is not a contraindication. Bronchoscopy is permissible in pregnancy and PH when benefits outweigh risks and appropriate safeguards are in place. In PH, available data do not show a consistent increase in TBLB bleeding, but oxygenation and ventilatory risks are higher. In pregnancy, decisions should be multidisciplinary and tailored to urgency, alternatives, and airway strategy.

Pre‑Procedure Evaluation

Bleeding risk stratification

Patient factors: lung cancer, transplant, immunosuppression; controversial/variable risk with PH.

Procedure factors: TBLB and cryobiopsy carry higher bleeding risk than EBUS/BAL/brushings.

Hemostasis factors: uremia, liver disease, antithrombotics; coagulation tests alone are poor predictors.

Tissue factors: carcinoid, renal/thyroid metastases, amyloid, anthracosis, and bronchial Dieulafoy lesions are highly vascular.

Pragmatic laboratory thresholds

BAL typically acceptable with platelets >=20 × 10³/µL.

Endobronchial/TBLB generally acceptable with platelets >=50 × 10³/µL.

Antithrombotics (typical diagnostic bronchoscopy windows)

Warfarin: stop ~5 d (goal INR <1.5 day‑of), restart same evening if safe.

DOACs: hold ~24-48 h; extend for renal dysfunction (especially dabigatran).

Clopidogrel: hold ~5-7 d for biopsies; EBUS‑TBNA may be performed in select scenarios.

Aspirin: usually continued.

LMWH/fondaparinux: shorter holds (see Table 2).

Pregnancy planning

Avoid the nasal route; NPO and aspiration precautions; wedge the right hip or consider a semi‑upright position; lowest effective lidocaine dose; discuss fetal monitoring and emergency plans.

PH planning

Continue PAH therapies (e.g., sildenafil, inhaled prostacyclin analogs). Avoid hypoxemia/hypercarbia, pain/anxiety, and abrupt preload reduction. Favor gentle technique with adequate topical anesthesia.

Equipment & Setup

Large‑channel bronchoscope; robust suction; cold saline; topical vasoconstrictors (epinephrine, tranexamic acid); vasopressin analogs where appropriate; balloon blockers; fibrin sealant or silicone plugs; thermal tools (APC, laser, monopolar electrocautery) for select bleeding scenarios.

Monitoring: continuous SpO₂ and ECG during and after the procedure; consider HFNC for high‑risk desaturation.

Step‑by‑Step Technique / Procedural Checklist

Team brief: indication, alternatives, anticoagulant plan, airway strategy, and backup (rigid, ICU, BAE).

Sedation: midazolam + fentanyl titration; avoid large boluses. If using propofol, anesthesia support is recommended. Reversal agents drawn up.

Oxygenation: start supplemental O₂ in high‑risk patients; HFNC for those prone to desaturation.

Pregnancy: avoid nasal route; wedge right hip; minimize hypercarbia; plan for aspiration risk and difficult airway.

PH: continue PAH meds; avoid maneuvers that increase PVR; maintain preload; ensure gentle instrumentation.

Troubleshooting & Intra‑Procedure Management

Bleeding: Keep the scope in; suction for visibility; position bleeding lung down; instill cold 4 °C saline aliquots; apply topical epinephrine (typical diluted range 1:10,000-1:100,000; many operators keep cumulative endobronchial epinephrine <=~0.6 mg) or tranexamic acid (e.g., 250 mg diluted, 1-3 aliquots). Escalate to balloon tamponade, fibrin sealant/silicone plugs, and rigid bronchoscopy/BAE as needed.

Hypoxemia: Increase FiO₂; pause instillations; suction secretions/blood; HFNC or NIV if needed.

Arrhythmias: Usually benign; treat triggers (hypoxemia, pain). Maintain ECG monitoring.

Laryngospasm: Prevent with adequate topical lidocaine before passing the cords; treat with oxygenation, jaw thrust, positive pressure; deepen anesthesia if necessary.

Sedation mishaps: Keep flumazenil and naloxone immediately available; recognize fentanyl‑induced chest‑wall rigidity and support ventilation while reversing.

Post‑Procedure Care & Follow‑Up

Monitor in a staffed recovery area for 2-4 hours: SpO₂ (return to baseline), chest pain/desaturation (consider pneumothorax), temperature (self‑limited fever common after BAL), airway patency/bronchospasm, and level of consciousness. Keep NPO until cough reflex returns (~2 h). Symptomatic pneumothorax warrants imaging (CXR or lung ultrasound). Small (<20%) pneumothoraces can often be observed; larger or unstable cases require drainage.

Complications: Prevention, Recognition, Management

Bleeding: Highest risk with vascular tumors and TBLB/cryobiopsy. Prophylactic epinephrine prior to TBLB in select transplant populations reduces severe bleeding. Consider rigid bronchoscopy first in centrally vascular endobronchial tumors; thermal modalities can assist hemostasis.

Pneumothorax: Avoid bilateral same‑session TBLB; prefer alligator over cup forceps in sarcoidosis; fluoroscopy improves localization yield but doesn’t clearly reduce pneumothorax risk. Routine immediate CXR isn’t required; observe >=2 h due to possible delayed onset.

Infection/PBF: PBF is common after BAL and typically sterile. Prophylactic antibiotics do not reduce PBF. Procalcitonin can help distinguish bacterial infection from PBF. True bacteremia occurs in a minority; typical organisms include staphylococci and streptococci.

Bronchospasm: The most common life‑threatening airway event in older surveys. Routine pre‑procedure bronchodilators (short‑acting β‑agonists) have not shown clear benefit in COPD/asthma; optimize baseline disease control instead.

Special Populations

Pregnancy

Expect difficult airway and increased aspiration risk; avoid the nasal route; wedge the right hip for left uterine displacement; minimize hypercarbia; lowest effective lidocaine dose.

Use of topical endobronchial epinephrine is theoretical concern for uterine blood‑flow reduction—try safer measures first and weigh risk-benefit if considering its use.

Thermal tools have not been studied in pregnancy but may be used when necessary for life‑threatening airway obstruction; ensure appropriate dispersive electrode placement and obstetric input.

Multidisciplinary coordination (IP, anesthesia, obstetrics, referring team) is essential, including airway plan, personnel, and emergency contingencies.

Pulmonary Hypertension

No consistent increase in TBLB bleeding risk; however, higher risk of peri‑procedural hypoxemia and prolonged mechanical ventilation.

Avoid PH decompensation by preventing hypoxemia/hypercarbia, treating pain/anxiety, minimizing airway trauma, and maintaining preload. Continue PAH therapies unless specific contraindications exist.

Evidence & Outcomes

Bleeding classification schemes based on interventions provide reliable triggers for escalation. HFNC reduces hypoxemia episodes during bronchoscopy. In PH, bleeding risk from TBLB is not clearly elevated, but oxygenation/ventilation complications are more common and should shape peri‑procedural planning.

Cases & Applied Learning

Case 1 - PH and ILD Workup
A 62‑year‑old with scleroderma‑ILD and mean PAP 40 mmHg is referred for BAL/TBLB for new ground‑glass opacities. Which statement best reflects risk?
Answer: PH increases the risk of peri‑procedural hypoxemia and prolonged ventilation; bleeding risk with TBLB is not clearly increased.
Teaching point: Optimize oxygenation/ventilation, avoid triggers of increased PVR, and coordinate with anesthesia.

Case 2 - EBUS in Pregnancy
A 29‑year‑old at 22 weeks with suspected mediastinal involvement from breast cancer is scheduled for EBUS. What are the key priorities?
Answer: Anticipate difficult airway; avoid nasal route; wedge the right hip for left uterine displacement; minimize hypercarbia; coordinate with anesthesia and obstetrics.
Teaching point: Two‑patient physiology; focus on airway protection and hemodynamic stability.

Case 3 - Post‑TBLB Dyspnea
Two hours post‑TBLB, a patient reports pleuritic chest pain and desaturates to 89%.
Answer: Evaluate for pneumothorax with CXR or lung ultrasound; small pneumothoraces may be observed, larger/unstable require drainage.
Teaching point: Routine post‑TBLB CXR is unnecessary in asymptomatic patients, but delayed pneumothorax can occur.

Controversies & Evolving Evidence

PH and bleeding risk: Earlier opinions labeled PH a relative/absolute contraindication to TBLB; newer analyses do not show a clear bleeding increase, but they do show higher rates of hypoxemia and prolonged ventilation.

Routine bronchodilator premedication: Trials in COPD/asthma show no clear benefit for routine pre‑procedure short‑acting β‑agonists; practice varies—optimize baseline control instead.

Fluoroscopy: Improves localization and diagnostic yield in focal disease but has not clearly reduced pneumothorax rates; use is center‑specific.

Sedation ownership: Conscious/moderate sedation by pulmonologists versus propofol by anesthesia varies by institution; propofol’s narrow therapeutic margin favors anesthesia involvement in many centers.

Topical epinephrine in pregnancy: Consider safer measures first; if used, employ the lowest effective dose with multidisciplinary input.

Take‑Home Checklist

Communicate real‑world risks (overall complications ~1%, mortality ~0.02%) during consent.

Prepare for bleeding: cold saline, vasoconstrictor, balloon blocker, sealants, rigid backup.

Apply antithrombotic holds pragmatically; aspirin is usually continued; verify INR for warfarin.

Use HFNC in desaturation‑prone patients; treat hypoxemia immediately.

Keep reversal agents (flumazenil, naloxone) drawn up; recognize chest‑wall rigidity.

Suspect pneumothorax if new chest pain/desaturation post‑TBLB; observe >=2 h; image if symptomatic.

Distinguish PBF from infection; procalcitonin can help; prophylactic antibiotics are not routine.

Pregnancy: avoid nasal route, wedge right hip, minimize hypercarbia, lowest effective lidocaine, multidisciplinary team.

PH: continue PAH meds; avoid increased PVR; anticipate hypoxemia risk more than bleeding.
