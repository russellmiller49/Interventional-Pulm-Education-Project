Pneumothorax, Prolonged Air Leaks, and Bronchopleural Fistula
Exam Mapping & Scope

This chapter covers recognition and management of pneumothorax (primary, secondary, iatrogenic, traumatic), persistent/prolonged air leaks (PAL), alveolar‑pleural fistula (APF), and bronchopleural fistula (BPF). It emphasizes guideline‑concordant triage, procedural steps (needle aspiration, chest drains, ambulatory systems), bronchoscopic therapies (valves, spigots, sealants, stents, occluders), surgical options, and complication prevention. Domains: pleural disease, interventional pulmonology (diagnostic and therapeutic bronchoscopy), peri‑procedural management.

Learning Objectives

Distinguish PSP vs SSP, APF vs BPF, and define PAL; recognize when “size” alone should not dictate management.

Select initial management (conservative, needle aspiration, ambulatory device, chest tube) based on stability, risk, and setting.

Execute a stepwise approach to localizing and treating PAL using balloon occlusion, methylene blue, capnography, and/or Chartis.

Choose and perform bronchoscopic therapies (valves, spigots, sealants, stents, occluders) for PAL/BPF, including indications and pitfalls.

Optimize chest tube strategy (water‑seal vs suction), outpatient options (Heimlich valve), and post‑episode counseling (recurrence prevention, air travel).

Anticipate complications and tailor approaches in special populations (COPD, post‑resection, ventilated patients, empyema).

High‑Yield One‑Pager

Terminology: APF = parenchymal air leak distal to segmental bronchus; BPF = communication between central airway (main/lobar/segmental) and pleural space. PAL = air leak persisting >5 days after drainage.

PSP epidemiology: young, tall, thin smokers; recurrence common; size alone does not define instability.

SSP: older patients with underlying lung disease (e.g., COPD); higher morbidity; tension more common.

Ultrasound pearls: lung sliding and B‑lines exclude PTX; “barcode/stratosphere” suggests PTX; lung point is diagnostic.

Initial PSP approach: if minimally symptomatic and stable, conservative management is reasonable; otherwise needle aspiration preferred over routine large‑bore drains.

Ambulatory management: small‑bore catheter + one‑way valve can shorten hospitalization in selected PSP but has more device‑related events; not recommended for SSP.

Chest tube strategy: favor small‑bore; water‑seal over routine suction; consider Heimlich valve for outpatient drainage.

PAL localization: sequential balloon occlusion from lobe→segment; watch drainage system for bubbling changes; consider methylene blue, capnography, or Chartis if subtle.

Valves: Zephyr® and Spiration® one‑way valves allow egress without inflow; helpful for PALs and selected BPFs when surgery is high risk; reassess for removal ≈6 weeks after leak resolution.

Spigots: silicone plugs (EWS) sized to the airway; dislocation is common—cough suppression helps.

Sealants: fibrin/cyanoacrylate glue; great for small/visible defects; avoid suction during curing; mind the bronchoscope!

Stents/occluders: covered stents for central defects; Amplatzer® devices close select BPFs; reserve for specialized centers.

BPF timing post‑resection: early (<=7 d), intermediate (8-30 d), late (>30 d); right pneumonectomy risk > left.

Infection/empyema: drain first; treat sepsis; don’t rush to close a fistula through infection.

Ventilated patients: minimize PEEP/tidal volume; consider selective contralateral intubation for large BPF.

Core Concepts
Pathophysiology & Epidemiology

Pneumothorax: air in pleural space collapses lung; in PSP, subpleural blebs/bullae and pleural porosity are implicated; risk heightened by tobacco and cannabis use. SSP arises from underlying disease (e.g., COPD, cystic lung disorders), necrotizing infections, or barotrauma.

APF vs BPF: APF arises from alveolar/pleural disruption; usually peripheral and not directly visualized. BPF is a central airway defect; common after resection (lobectomy/pneumonectomy) and in necrotizing infection or malignancy.

PAL: persistence >5 days; common after lung volume reduction, lobectomy, or severe parenchymal disease.

Indications & Contraindications

Conservative PSP: stable, minimally symptomatic adults regardless of size.
Needle aspiration: hemodynamically stable PSP with symptomatic or larger PTX.
Ambulatory device: selected PSP with reliable follow‑up; avoid in SSP.
Chest tube: unstable patients; SSP; failed aspiration; significant physiologic compromise; ventilated patients.
Bronchoscopic PAL/BPF therapy: failure or non‑candidacy for surgery; small to moderate defects; localized leak.
Surgery: early post‑resection BPF; failed bronchoscopic therapy; large central defects; recurrence prevention when feasible.

Pre‑procedure Evaluation

Imaging: Upright CXR for PTX; CT for complex/recurrent cases or underlying pathology; ultrasound at bedside for rapid triage. For suspected BPF: look for new air-fluid levels, pleural space volume changes, subcutaneous emphysema.

Bronchoscopy: inspect stump/central airways; saline bubbling test; methylene blue (endobronchial or retrograde via drain); balloon occlusion for localization; capnography and/or airway pressure tracings; Chartis catheter for distal pressure/flow.

Risk stratification: post‑resection timing; infection/empyema; nutritional status; immunosuppression; guideline “high‑risk” features (e.g., bilateral PTX, age >=50 with smoking, hypoxemia, hemopneumothorax).

Consent: discuss recurrence prevention (pleurodesis, surgery), device removal (valves/spigots), potential need for staged procedures.

Equipment & Setup

Needle aspiration: small‑bore catheter; mid‑clavicular 2nd ICS.

Ambulatory device: 6-8 Fr catheter with in‑line one‑way valve.

Chest drains: small‑bore favored; connect to water‑seal; digital drainage systems help quantify leak.

Bronchoscopy: therapeutic scope (>=2.8‑mm channel), occlusion balloons (Fogarty/balloon catheter), methylene blue, capnography line, Chartis (where available), valve delivery system, Watanabe spigots (5, 6, 7 mm), sealant catheters, stent/occluder kits, graspers/forceps, suction traps.

Sealant delivery: dual‑lumen catheters for fibrin components; externalize catheter with scope during curing to protect the working channel.

Step‑by‑Step Technique / Procedural Checklist

Needle Aspiration (PSP)

Confirm stability; analgesia and sterile prep.

Insert small‑bore catheter at 2nd ICS mid‑clavicular; aspirate air manually.

Re‑image for expansion; observe several hours; repeat aspiration if needed.

Chest Tube Placement

Indication confirmed; ultrasound guidance if fluid/loculations.

4th-5th ICS mid‑axillary; Seldinger technique for small‑bore.

Connect to water‑seal; avoid routine suction; assess leak on inspiration/expiration; consider digital systems.

Balloon‑Occlusion Mapping of PAL

Deep sedation or GA with closed‑circuit ventilation to stabilize flows.

Begin at lobar orifice → sequentially occlude segments; observe leak changes (>=1 minute per site).

Address collateral ventilation; if localization equivocal, augment with low‑flow O₂ insufflation via bronchoscope suction port in short bursts to highlight culprit segment; or instill methylene blue.

Endobronchial Valve Placement

Size and number determined by mapping; place proximally to encompass culprit segments with least valves.

Confirm immediate effect on leak and radiographic improvement.

Reassess for removal ~6 weeks after leak resolves to minimize infection/granulation.

Sealant/Glue Application (central, small defects)

Dry field; gently apply fibrin or cyanoacrylate via catheter positioned away from the scope tip.

Avoid suction during curing; remove excess congealed material to preserve lumen.

Consider scaffolds (e.g., polyglycolic acid mesh) to anchor sealant in select cases.

Watanabe Spigot Placement

Size to airway; advance with forceps to wedge; verify cessation/reduction of leak.

Counsel on cough suppression; monitor for migration; remove when leak closes.

Stents and Occluders (selected central BPFs)

Covered stents to bridge central defects and protect against contamination.

Amplatzer devices sized to fistula waist; ensure retrievability before release.

Troubleshooting & Intra‑procedure Management

No leak reduction on occlusion: evaluate for collateral ventilation; expand occlusion field proximally; reassess tube position/obstruction.

Tiny central defects: dye instillation and targeted sealant may outperform valves.

Sealant pitfalls: avoid suction and scope contact; remove catheter/scope en bloc if glue near tip; never force clogged glue through a catheter.

Valves: if persistent leak, re‑map for additional contributing segments; watch for secretion impaction; plan surveillance bronchoscopy if mucus plugging suspected.

Post‑procedure Care & Follow‑up

Keep drains on water‑seal unless clinical reason for suction emerges.

Consider ambulatory Heimlich valve for persistent but controlled leaks in selected patients.

Flight: advise to delay commercial air travel until CXR confirms resolution, then wait ~7 days; persistent closed pneumothorax should not fly.

Recurrence prevention: smoking cessation; counsel on triggers; discuss pleurodesis or surgery after recurrent PSP, first SSP, bilateral events, or high‑risk occupations.

Complications (Prevention, Recognition, Management)

Valves/spigots/stents: mucus plugging, infection, granulation, migration; mitigate with airway clearance, scheduled follow‑up, and device removal when feasible.

Sealants: foreign‑body granuloma, airway obstruction; remove excess material promptly.

Surgery‑related BPF: empyema and sepsis; consider staged drainage (e.g., Eloesser) with nutrition/rehab prior to definitive closure.

Ventilator management: avoid high PEEP/pressures; consider single‑lung ventilation to protect large BPFs.

Special Populations

Post‑resection: early BPF (<=4-7 days) often requires prompt surgical re‑exploration and stump closure; late BPF frequently occurs with infection/ischemia—drain and treat infection before closure.

Severe COPD or diffuse emphysema: PALs common; fissure integrity predicts valve success; incomplete fissures lower efficacy.

Malignancy: rapid tumor response may unmask fistulas; stenting/occluders often palliative.

Empyema: prioritize continuous drainage; antibiotics; delay fistula closure until controlled.

Evidence & Outcomes (selected data points)

Needle aspiration shortens hospital stay vs chest tube in PSP (also seen in SSP subsets in pragmatic trials).

Conservative PSP management is non‑inferior for radiographic re‑expansion in selected patients and reduces serious adverse events and recurrences, with careful selection.

Ambulatory PSP devices reduce length of stay but increase device‑related adverse events; not recommended for SSP.

Endobronchial valves for PAL: resolution rates across series range widely; fissure completeness and absence of collateral ventilation predict success.

Endoscopic closure success is highest for small BPFs (<6-8 mm); larger central defects often require surgery or custom solutions.

Watanabe spigots can reduce leaks and permit tube removal in most series; dislocation is common; national datasets show meaningful failure and mortality in frail cohorts, underscoring careful selection.

Cases & Applied Learning

Case 1 (Next‑Best Step).
A 24‑year‑old man (tall, thin smoker) presents with pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea. Vitals stable, SpO₂ 97% RA. CXR shows a moderate PSP. Lung ultrasound shows absent sliding anteriorly with a visible lung point.
What is the next best step?
A. Large‑bore chest tube with suction
B. Needle aspiration
C. Ambulatory small‑bore catheter with one‑way valve (SSP)
D. Immediate VATS
E. Non‑contrast CT

Answer: B. For stable, symptomatic PSP, needle aspiration is preferred over routine chest tubes. Ambulatory management may be reasonable in centers with pathways, but the question asks for the next best step; SSP wording in option C is incorrect for this patient.

Case 2 (Troubleshooting).
A 68‑year‑old with COPD and SSP has a persistent grade‑3 air leak on day 5 despite a well‑positioned small‑bore drain on water‑seal. You plan bronchoscopic therapy. Under GA, balloon occlusion of the presumed lobe does not change the air leak.
Which maneuver is most helpful to localize the leak?
A. Increase PEEP to 12 cm H₂O to exaggerate the leak
B. Endobronchial oxygen insufflation via the bronchoscope suction port
C. Add continuous suction to the chest drain
D. Place a covered tracheal stent
E. Instill talc via the bronchoscope

Answer: B. Low‑flow endobronchial O₂ insufflation in short bursts can augment flow in culprit segments when mapping under GA is equivocal. Avoid increasing ventilator pressures that may worsen the leak.

Case 3 (Strategy Selection).
A 62‑year‑old man 10 days after right pneumonectomy develops fever and productive cough. CXR shows a change in the air-fluid level; bronchoscopy reveals stump dehiscence with bubbling on saline instillation.
Best initial strategy?
A. Immediate stump glue
B. Covered stent across carina
C. Start antibiotics and ensure wide pleural drainage; consider staged closure
D. High‑frequency oscillatory ventilation
E. Autologous blood patch via chest tube as sole therapy

Answer: C. Post‑pneumonectomy BPF with infection requires source control with broad drainage and antibiotics before definitive closure (surgical or combined staged approaches).

Question Bank (MCQs)

1. A 30‑year‑old with PSP is minimally symptomatic and stable. CXR shows a large PTX by ATS criteria. Which statement is most accurate?
A. Size mandates chest tube insertion
B. Conservative management can be considered
C. Ambulatory SSP protocol should be used
D. Immediate VATS is required
E. Thoracic suction reduces recurrence

Answer: B. In stable, minimally symptomatic PSP, conservative care is reasonable regardless of size. Size alone no longer drives invasive management.

2. In SSP with a persistent air leak on day 5, which chest tube strategy is preferred initially?
A. Continuous wall suction for all
B. Water‑seal, avoid routine suction
C. Remove the tube to encourage closure
D. Replace with large‑bore tube immediately
E. Clamp continuously for 24 h

Answer: B. Water‑seal is favored; suction can splint the fistula open and is not recommended routinely.

3. Which ultrasound finding is diagnostic of pneumothorax?
A. Absent lung sliding
B. Barcode/stratosphere sign
C. Lung point
D. Absence of B‑lines
E. Lung pulse

Answer: C. Lung point is diagnostic; absent sliding and barcode are suggestive but not specific.

4. A 66‑year‑old after lobectomy has a central airway defect visible on bronchoscopy ~4 mm in size without purulence. Best bronchoscopic option?
A. One‑way valves in all lobar segments
B. Fibrin/cyanoacrylate sealant applied directly
C. Uncovered metal stent
D. Amplatzer occluder (40 mm)
E. Endobronchial spigot in the trachea

Answer: B. Small, central defects respond well to targeted sealant; stents/occluders are reserved for selected larger central fistulas.

5. During fibrin glue application to a BPF, which is most important to prevent equipment damage?
A. Suction immediately to clear excess glue
B. Advance the catheter so its tip is flush with the scope
C. Keep glue away from scope; avoid suction; remove catheter/scope together if needed
D. Increase oxygen flows
E. Use single‑lumen catheter to inject components sequentially

Answer: C. Glue contacting the scope or entering the working channel can permanently damage it; avoid suction during curing.

6. Which factor predicts better success with endobronchial valves for PAL?
A. Extensive interlobar collateral ventilation
B. Complete fissures without collateral ventilation
C. Large, diffuse emphysema
D. Bilateral leaks
E. Current empyema

Answer: B. Absence of collateral ventilation (complete fissure) improves valve success.

7. Which is a recognized risk factor for postoperative BPF after pneumonectomy?
A. Left‑sided surgery
B. Short stump
C. Preoperative neoadjuvant radiation
D. Female sex
E. Low secretion pooling on the right

Answer: C. Neoadjuvant radiotherapy and right‑sided operations increase BPF risk; right stumps pool secretions more.

8. A 74‑year‑old with COPD and SSP is ambulatory and requests outpatient care. Which is true?
A. Ambulatory management with small‑bore one‑way valve is guideline‑endorsed for SSP
B. Ambulatory PSP data show reduced LOS but more device events; not recommended for SSP
C. Ambulatory devices eliminate recurrence risk
D. Ambulatory management requires large‑bore tubes
E. Ambulatory management requires routine suction

Answer: B. Ambulatory devices in PSP shorten stay but increase adverse events; not recommended for SSP.

9. After mapping, two valves are placed in RB6 and RB9 for PAL; leak decreases but persists. Next step?
A. Remove both valves immediately
B. Add suction to the drain
C. Re‑map for additional contributing segments and place additional valve(s) as needed
D. Place tracheal stent
E. Start talc via the chest tube

Answer: C. PALs often involve multiple segments; re‑map and extend occlusion judiciously.

10. Which statement about Watanabe spigots is correct?
A. They are metal coils that expand and embed
B. They are silicone plugs; migration is common; antitussives may be used
C. They are permanent devices not intended to be removed
D. They require balloon activation
E. They are contraindicated in segmental airways

Answer: B. EWS are silicone, radiopaque plugs; dislocation is a known issue; remove when leak closes.

11. A 58‑year‑old post‑pneumonectomy patient with empyema and BPF. Best immediate plan:
A. Sealant and stent during the same bronchoscopy
B. Eloesser/open drainage with antibiotics and nutrition, then consider closure
C. ABP alone via chest tube
D. High PEEP to tamponade the fistula
E. Start anticoagulation to improve flow

Answer: B. Continuous drainage with infection control and rehabilitation precedes definitive closure.

12. Post‑PSP, the CXR today shows full resolution. When is it reasonable to clear for commercial flight if asymptomatic?
A. Immediately
B. 24 hours
C. ~7 days after radiographic resolution
D. After pleurodesis
E. After CT confirms normal lung

Answer: C. Waiting about a week after radiographic resolution reduces early recurrence risk during flight.

Controversies, Variability, and Evolving Evidence

Conservative PSP management: Growing support for selected patients; careful selection is essential.

Ambulatory PSP: Shorter hospital stay but higher device events; practice varies by center and patient preference.

Suction: Evidence is insufficient to recommend routine suction for PSP/SSP; many favor water‑seal initially.

Endobronchial valves for PAL/BPF: Heterogeneous cohorts and variable definitions limit comparability; expert consensus supports use in high‑risk patients with localized leaks.

Spigots and occluders: Adoption varies; national outcomes highlight the importance of patient selection and center expertise.

Regulatory note: Endobronchial valves for PAL have been used under special regulatory pathways in some regions; device selection and indications evolve.

Take‑Home Checklist

Confirm APF vs BPF and PAL (>5 days)—the label guides therapy.

PSP stable/minimally symptomatic? Consider conservative pathway; otherwise needle aspiration before drains.

Prefer small‑bore chest tubes and water‑seal; avoid routine suction.

For SSP, inpatient management with chest drain and close monitoring.

Map before you treat PAL: sequential balloon occlusion; augment with dye/capnography/Chartis as needed.

Valves/spigots: target the smallest set of segments that abolishes the leak; plan timely removal.

Central, small BPFs: sealant or occluder; large/complex BPFs: likely surgical ± staged drainage.

Infection control first in empyema‑associated BPF.

On a ventilator: minimize PEEP/tidal volume; consider selective ventilation.

Counsel on recurrence prevention (smoking cessation) and air travel timing.

Use digital drainage systems when available to quantify and follow leak.

Document a clear follow‑up plan for device checks and removal.
