Non‑Malignant CAO
Exam Mapping & Scope

This chapter covers benign central airway obstruction (CAO) and expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), including structural stenoses (post‑intubation/tracheostomy, post‑infectious, inflammatory/immune‑mediated, idiopathic, transplant‑related), intraluminal benign tumors, extrinsic compression/distortion, and dynamic entities (tracheobronchomalacia [TBM], excessive dynamic airway collapse [EDAC]). It emphasizes diagnosis, stabilization, bronchoscopic and surgical management, stents, peri‑procedural anesthesia/ventilation, complications, and outcomes with an exam‑focused approach for AABIP/CAQ.

Learning Objectives

Distinguish structural from functional (dynamic) causes of non‑malignant CAO and map each to first‑line diagnostic and therapeutic options.

Recognize airway emergencies and outline a stepwise stabilization plan, including when to avoid tracheotomy and when to consider rigid bronchoscopy or ECMO.

Classify benign stenoses as simple vs complex and execute the mucosa‑sparing radial incision + dilation technique.

Select appropriate ablative/dilation modalities and airway stents for benign disease, and anticipate device‑specific complications.

Construct a management plan for inflammatory/infectious stenoses (e.g., GPA, post‑TB) integrating systemic therapy with bronchoscopic interventions.

Evaluate and treat EDAC/TBM, including CPAP trials, stent trials, and criteria for tracheobronchoplasty.

Anticipate, prevent, and manage peri‑procedural complications (fire, bleeding, barotrauma, hypercapnia, restenosis, stent‑related events).

High‑Yield One‑Pager

Definition: Clinically significant CAO ≈ >50% reduction in cross‑sectional area (CSA) of trachea/main bronchi/bronchus intermedius.

Symptoms vs caliber: DOE typically when lumen &lt;25–50% of normal; rest symptoms/stridor ≈ ~5 mm tracheal diameter.

Emergency priorities: Don’t force an ETT through a tight stenosis; park the ETT proximal to the lesion or use an LMA. Avoid upfront tracheotomy if feasible. Early call for rigid bronchoscopy in the OR. Consider VV‑ECMO (or standby cannulas) when high risk of losing the airway.

Imaging: High‑resolution CT defines length, mechanism, distal patency; paired end‑inspiratory/dynamic expiratory CT evaluates EDAC/TBM.

Spirometry clues: Flattened inspiratory/expiratory limbs (fixed obstruction); variable extrathoracic vs intrathoracic patterns; biphasic curve may suggest a main bronchial lesion; “saw‑tooth” can appear with TBM/upper airway flutter.

Simple vs complex stenosis: Simple = concentric, weblike, length &lt;10 mm, no malacia → radial cuts + gentle ballooning (mucosa‑sparing). Complex = ≥10 mm and/or cartilage damage/malacia → likely needs stenting ± surgery.

Mucosa‑sparing technique: 3 radial incisions into fibrotic bands (avoid normal mucosa), then low‑trauma balloon dilation.

Benign stents: Silicone preferred (removable, adjustable). Avoid uncovered SEMS in benign disease (complications, difficult removal).

Post‑TB left main bronchus: Balloon‑only durability is poor; many require silicone stenting (monitor for restenosis/granulation/migration).

Inflammatory stenoses (e.g., GPA): Combine immunosuppression with endoscopic cuts/dilation; intralesional steroids or mitomycin C (MMC) used variably; avoid stents if possible (can amplify inflammation).

EDAC/TBM: Start with CPAP (pneumatic splint). Short stent trial (~2 weeks) can select candidates for tracheobronchoplasty (mesh splinting of posterior membrane) or focal resection for localized malacia.

Peri‑procedural anesthesia: Rigid bronchoscopy under TIVA (propofol), short‑acting opioids, neuromuscular blockade (e.g., rocuronium). Jet ventilation is convenient but risks hypercapnia/barotrauma; conventional ventilation is leak‑sensitive.

Fire prevention: With laser keep FiO₂ &lt;40%; with electrocautery/APC, FiO₂ &lt;30%.

Key pitfall: Aggressive dilation or injudicious tracheotomy can lengthen a resectable stenosis and jeopardize surgery.

Core Concepts
Pathophysiology / Epidemiology

Structural CAO mechanisms: intraluminal tumors or diffuse mucosal disease (e.g., papillomatosis, amyloidosis, tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica), extrinsic compression/distortion (goiter, cysts, lymphadenopathy, vascular rings/slings, post‑pneumonectomy rotation), and stricture/scar (post‑intubation/tracheostomy, post‑TB, GPA, RP, idiopathic laryngotracheal stenosis).

Functional CAO (ECAC): TBM (cartilage weakness) vs EDAC (posterior membrane bowing) with expiratory reduction in CSA; both cause cough, wheeze, mucostasis, recurrent infections; spirometry often nonspecific.

Indications & Contraindications

Emergency bronchoscopy: stridor + distress; hypercapnic/hypoxemic failure due to CAO.

Therapeutic bronchoscopy: symptomatic CAO, impending airway compromise, or to bridge to surgery; also when systemic therapy alone is insufficient (e.g., post‑TB scar).

Surgery: definitive for resectable strictures (typically &lt;~½ tracheal length; tension‑free anastomosis essential). Consider patient fitness and avoid pre‑procedural maneuvers that lengthen lesions ≥40 mm.

Contraindications (relative): active uncontrolled inflammation (e.g., GPA flare) for surgery; uncovered SEMS in benign disease; laser/APC with high FiO₂; cryospray without effective gas egress.

Pre‑procedure Evaluation

History: prior intubation/tracheostomy, TB or granulomatous disease, systemic autoimmune disease, transplant, GERD, chemical/thermal injury.

Exam/red flags: new wheeze unresponsive to inhalers, monophonic rhonchi, stridor, recurrent infection.

Tests: HRCT (stenosis length, mechanism, distal airway), dynamic CT for EDAC/TBM; spirometry with flow‑volume loop patterns; plan rigid bronchoscopy when obstruction is severe or diagnosis/therapy likely.

Airway strategy: Choose ETT that can pass without force; if not, park proximal or use LMA. Avoid upfront tracheotomy when possible.

Team & site: OR with interventional pulmonology, thoracic surgery, ENT, anesthesia; consider VV‑ECMO (pre‑emptive or standby sheaths) when losing airway is a real risk.

Equipment & Setup

Rigid bronchoscope/tracheoscope set with jet or conventional ventilation; flexible scope through rigid barrel as needed.

Dilation tools: graded balloons (30–120 s inflations; incremental sizes), semi‑rigid bougies, rigid barrel “telescope” technique.

Ablation tools: electrocautery knife/needle, APC, laser; cryoprobe (recanalization; delayed cryotherapy); cryospray (liquid nitrogen—requires open circuit/deflated cuff).

Stents: silicone straight/Y/hourglass; Montgomery T‑tube for subglottis/high trachea; external fixation sutures can help prevent migration.

Step‑by‑Step Technique / Procedural Checklist

Confirm plan (emergency vs semielective; rescue options, ECMO standby).

Induction with TIVA; paralysis to facilitate rigid scope; pre‑oxygenate and set safe FiO₂ for energy device.

Diagnostic pass to map lesion: location, length, morphology, distal patency, presence of malacia, active inflammation.

Simple web (&lt;10 mm, no malacia): three radial cuts through scar bands only, then gentle balloon dilation; avoid circumferential mucosal stripping.

Complex stenosis (≥10 mm, ± malacia): targeted cuts of fibrotic sectors → graded dilation; if recoil/inflammation persists, size and place silicone stent; consider external fixation if high/subglottic.

Intraluminal tumors: mechanical coring + hot/cold ablation as needed; hemostasis plan ready.

Diffuse disease (TO/amyloid): conservative unless symptomatic; anticipate bleeding with ablation; consider EBRT for amyloidosis.

EDAC/TBM: CPAP trial; if severe, short stent trial to confirm symptom relief; then tracheobronchoplasty (posterior membrane plication to mesh) or focal resection for localized malacia.

Adjuncts: intralesional steroids (commonly, depot methylprednisolone in multiple quadrants) and/or MMC (regimens vary; see “Controversies”).

Debrief & surveillance: document classification, technique, device sizes, FiO₂ limits, complications; plan follow‑up bronchoscopy when stented (typically 6–12 months intervals).

Troubleshooting & Intra‑procedure Management

Hypoxia/hypercapnia: with jet ventilation, pause, manual ventilate, assess air trapping/barotrauma; with conventional ventilation, mitigate leaks (pack oropharynx), hand‑ventilate, pause intervention.

Airway fire risk: keep FiO₂ ≤40% for laser, ≤30% for electrocautery/APC; coordinate device bursts with oxygen reduction.

Bleeding: tamponade with rigid barrel, iced saline, APC/laser coagulation; avoid deep cuts on posterior membrane.

Cryospray distress: stop spray, ensure cuff deflated/open circuit, allow gas egress; manage barotrauma promptly if suspected.

Stent issues: early migration—re‑size or add external fixation; granulation—targeted ablation and optimize stent‑tissue apposition; mucostasis—humidification, airway clearance.

Post‑procedure Care & Follow‑up

Immediate: humidified O₂, airway clearance, bronchodilators PRN; analgesia and cough control; reflux management.

Stented airways: routine surveillance bronchoscopy (e.g., 6–12 months), earlier if symptoms; anticipate granulation, migration, mucostasis.

Inflammatory etiologies: coordinate systemic therapy (immunosuppression for GPA/RP; antimicrobials for TB/fungal disease).

Surgery referrals: early for resectable strictures; avoid interventions that lengthen lesions if surgery feasible.

Complications (Prevention, Recognition, Management)

Laser/electrocautery fire → strict FiO₂ limits, short bursts, suction plume; extinguish and cool if occurs.

Barotrauma (jet, cryospray) → monitor ETCO₂ and chest compliance; stop source, decompress, treat pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum.

Bleeding (tumors/amyloid/broncholiths) → tamponade, coagulate, transfuse as indicated.

Stent‑related → granulation, mucostasis, migration; removal of metallic stents can cause retained fragments, mucosal tears, tension pneumothorax; reserve metal for select scenarios and with expertise.

Restenosis → repeat mucosa‑sparing dilation; escalate to stent or surgery based on phenotype.

Anastomotic problems (post‑surgery) → tension reduction strategies; steroids increase dehiscence risk; early recognition critical.

Special Populations

Post‑TB stenosis: often left main bronchus; balloon alone rarely durable; silicone stenting frequently needed; monitor for restenosis/granulation/migration; antifungals/antituberculous therapy as indicated.

GPA: combine immunosuppression with radial cuts/dilation; intralesional steroid ± MMC; avoid stents if possible.

Relapsing polychondritis: diffuse involvement common; medical therapy first; CPAP for diffuse TBM; focal dilation/stenting selectively; tracheotomy if refractory subglottic disease.

Idiopathic subglottic stenosis: predominates in middle‑aged women; often 20–30 mm segments; durable endoscopic results in simple lesions; surgery if complex or near‑glottic constraints; T‑tube or externally fixed silicone stent when surgery not feasible.

Lung transplant anastomosis stenosis: multifactorial; individualized multimodality care.

Extrinsic compression (goiter, cysts, vascular): definitive surgical correction when possible; anticipate post‑decompression malacia.

Evidence & Outcomes (Selected)

Mucosa‑sparing Nd:YAG cuts + gentle dilation improves simple subglottic/tracheal webs.

Balloon dilation improves caliber but may require repetition; longer inflations (30–120 s) and progressive sizing standard.

Silicone stents maintain patency in many benign strictures; uncovered metallic stents in benign disease carry high complication/removal risks and are generally discouraged.

Therapeutic bronchoscopy for CAO improves spirometry, symptoms, and survival in selected cohorts.

For EDAC/TBM, CPAP often relieves symptoms; short stent trials help identify responders to tracheobronchoplasty, which can improve quality of life and functional status.

Cases & Applied Learning

Case 1. A 46‑year‑old woman with progressive dyspnea has a concentric subglottic web measuring 8 mm in length; no malacia. Best next step?
A. En bloc circumferential excision
B. Radial electrocautery incisions + gentle balloon dilation
C. Place uncovered metallic stent
D. Immediate tracheotomy
E. High‑dose systemic steroids alone
Best answer: B. Simple web (&lt;10 mm, no malacia) is best managed with mucosa‑sparing radial cuts into scar bands followed by gentle ballooning. En bloc stripping increases scarring; uncovered SEMS is contraindicated; tracheotomy risks lesion extension; steroids alone won’t remodel dense scar.

Case 2. A 38‑year‑old man presents with stridor after prolonged ventilation. CT shows a 2.5‑cm upper tracheal stenosis with triangular (“A‑shaped”) lumen and cartilage fractures. After targeted cuts and dilation, recoil persists. Best device choice now?
A. Silicone stent with external fixation
B. Uncovered SEMS
C. Covered SEMS
D. Montgomery T‑tube with proximal limb abutting cords
E. No implant; repeat ballooning only
Best answer: A. Complex stenosis with cartilage damage often requires a silicone stent, and high tracheal location benefits from external fixation. Uncovered SEMS is inappropriate; covered SEMS/hybrids are not first‑line; an ill‑positioned T‑tube can injure the subglottis.

Case 3. A 62‑year‑old with cough/wheeze and recurrent infections has dynamic CT showing >80% collapse of trachea and both main bronchi during forced expiration; bronchoscopy confirms TBM. CPAP helps but symptoms persist. What is the role of a short stent trial?
A. Long‑term therapy with permanent stents
B. Not indicated; proceed directly to surgery
C. Used briefly to confirm symptom responsiveness before tracheobronchoplasty
D. Contraindicated due to infection risk
E. Replace CPAP with systemic steroids
Best answer: C. A short stent trial (~2 weeks) helps select responders for tracheobronchoplasty; long‑term stenting is avoided if possible.

Question Bank (MCQs)

A previously healthy 35‑year‑old with post‑trauma distal left main bronchial stenosis has spirometry. Which flow–volume loop is most likely?
A. Fixed extrathoracic obstruction pattern
B. Variable intrathoracic obstruction pattern
C. Variable extrathoracic obstruction pattern
D. Biphasic expiratory flow pattern
E. Normal
Answer: D. A biphasic pattern is classically described with a mainstem endobronchial lesion; fixed/variable patterns point to different sites/physiology.

During rigid bronchoscopy for a tight tracheal web you plan laser radial incisions. Which oxygen strategy minimizes airway fire risk?
A. FiO₂ 100% for safety
B. FiO₂ 80% with short bursts
C. FiO₂ ≤40% with short bursts and continuous suction
D. FiO₂ 60% because laser is non‑contact
E. FiO₂ doesn’t matter if jet ventilation is used
Answer: C. Laser requires low FiO₂ (≤~40%), short bursts, and suction; high FiO₂ markedly increases fire risk.

Next best step: A 54‑year‑old with stridor and suspected subglottic stenosis is in mild distress in the ED. The ETT won’t pass the lesion.
A. Force the ETT through
B. Seat the ETT proximal to the lesion or use an LMA; expedite OR rigid bronchoscopy
C. Upfront tracheotomy
D. Nebulized bronchodilators and discharge
E. Awake flexible bronchoscopy at bedside
Answer: B. Forcing the tube risks hemorrhage/occlusion; avoid upfront tracheotomy if possible; definitive evaluation/therapy in OR.

Procedural troubleshooting: During jet ventilation, ETCO₂ climbs and chest becomes hyperinflated.
A. Increase jet frequency
B. Stop jet, allow exhalation; consider manual ventilation; evaluate for barotrauma
C. Increase FiO₂
D. Proceed faster to finish
E. Switch to APC
Answer: B. Hypercapnia/air trapping is a jet‑ventilation risk; pause and decompress to prevent barotrauma.

For simple, concentric, 6‑mm‑long tracheal web without malacia, the technique with the lowest restenosis risk is:
A. Balloon dilation alone with maximal pressure
B. Three mucosa‑sparing radial cuts → gentle balloon dilation
C. En bloc circumferential mucosal strip
D. Uncovered metallic stent
E. High‑dose systemic steroids for 2 weeks
Answer: B. Radial cuts into scar bands followed by gentle ballooning preserves mucosa and improves durability.

Next best step: Complex post‑tracheostomy stenosis (2.2 cm, cartilage fracture) recurs after ballooning.
A. Repeat ballooning weekly indefinitely
B. Silicone stenting with plan for surveillance; consider external fixation if high
C. Uncovered SEMS for better expansion
D. No further intervention; accept dyspnea
E. Immediate definitive resection in the ED
Answer: B. Complex disease often needs silicone stent; uncovered SEMS are contraindicated in benign disease.

Special populations: In GPA‑related subglottic stenosis, the most appropriate strategy is:
A. Uncovered metallic stent
B. Immunosuppression + endoscopic radial cuts/dilation ± intralesional steroid/MMC
C. Surgery first
D. Observation only
E. Reflux control alone
Answer: B. Treat systemic inflammation and perform conservative mucosa‑sparing endoscopic therapy; avoid stents when possible.

Complication awareness: Which of the following is a recognized risk when removing metallic airway stents?
A. Stent becomes invisible on fluoroscopy
B. Retained fragments, mucosal tears, restenosis needing re‑stenting, tension pneumothorax
C. Hypocalcemia
D. Permanent vocal cord paralysis is routine
E. None; removal is always straightforward
Answer: B. Metallic stent removal is high‑risk in benign airways; hence the general avoidance.

Energy device safety: With electrocautery in the airway, set FiO₂ to approximately:
A. 90%
B. 60%
C. ≤30%
D. Any level is safe
E. 0%
Answer: C. Keep FiO₂ as low as feasible (often ≤30%) to reduce fire risk during cautery/APC.

EDAC/TBM management: A patient remains symptomatic after optimized medical therapy and CPAP. What is the purpose of a short stent trial?
A. Long‑term treatment for malacia
B. Predict response before tracheobronchoplasty
C. Evaluate cough reflex
D. Replace the need for surgery
E. Diagnose GERD
Answer: B. A 1–2‑week trial helps select surgical candidates.

Mitomycin C variability: Which statement is accurate?
A. MMC is contraindicated in airways
B. Reported topical regimens vary (e.g., 0.4 mg/mL applied ~4 min; some use 2 mg in 5 mL via pledget) and may reduce scar proliferation
C. Only submucosal injection works
D. It invariably prevents restenosis
E. It replaces mechanical dilation
Answer: B. MMC dosing/time vary across practices; it’s an adjunct, not a replacement.

Post‑TB left main bronchus stenosis: Which is most consistent with outcomes?
A. Balloon dilation alone rarely maintains patency; many require silicone stenting
B. Uncovered SEMS provides best long‑term results
C. Surgery is always first‑line
D. Only antifungals are needed
E. EDAC is the most common mechanism
Answer: A. Durability of ballooning alone is poor; silicone stents maintain patency in many cases, with expected stent‑related events.

Controversies, Variability, and Evolving Evidence

MMC dosing/application: Regimens vary—from topical 0.4 mg/mL for ~4 minutes (≈0.4 mg total) to 2 mg/5 mL pledget applications; injection via TBNA is also described. Evidence suggests possible reduction in scar proliferation, but optimal dose/duration is unsettled.

Metallic stents in benign disease: A 2005 advisory cautioned against uncovered metallic stents in benign airways due to complications. Some centers report selected use of covered/hybrid designs as bridges or for unique anatomies, but removability and late complications remain concerns.

Dynamic collapse threshold: A >50% expiratory reduction defines malacia in many series; some programs stratify severity at >70–90% for surgical consideration. Spirometry is often nonspecific and not reliable for quantifying ECAC burden.

Ventilation strategy: Jet vs conventional ventilation choices vary by center; risk tolerance (hypercapnia/barotrauma vs leak sensitivity) guides practice.

Cryospray: Expanding role for scar remodeling and mucosa preservation, but strict attention to gas egress is essential to avoid barotrauma.

Take‑Home Checklist

Confirm structural vs functional mechanism; treat the cause.

Don’t force an ETT through a tight stenosis; avoid reflex tracheotomy when a definitive plan is coming.

Rigid bronchoscopy in the OR is the safest platform for severe CAO.

Keep FiO₂ ≤40% (laser) and ≤30% (cautery/APC) to prevent airway fire.

For simple webs (&lt;10 mm): radial cuts + gentle balloon; preserve mucosa.

For complex stenoses (≥10 mm/± malacia): targeted cuts → graded dilation → silicone stent (external fixation for high/subglottic).

Uncovered SEMS: avoid in benign disease.

Pair endoscopic therapy with systemic treatment (e.g., immunosuppression for GPA; antimicrobials for TB).

EDAC/TBM: optimize comorbidities → CPAP → short stent trial → tracheobronchoplasty if responsive.

Stented airways need surveillance; anticipate granulation, migration, mucostasis.

Involve a multidisciplinary team early, especially if surgery may be definitive.
