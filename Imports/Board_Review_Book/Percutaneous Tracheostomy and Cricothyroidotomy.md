Percutaneous Tracheostomy and Cricothyroidotomy

Target audience: IP fellows and practicing pulmonologists
Blueprint section: Interventional airway—tracheostomy (percutaneous vs surgical), emergency surgical airway (cricothyroidotomy)

Exam Mapping & Scope

This chapter covers indications, contraindications, patient selection, pre‑procedure evaluation, technique, troubleshooting, complications, and post‑procedure care for percutaneous dilational tracheostomy (PDT/PT) and cricothyroidotomy. Emphasis is placed on bedside decision‑making in the ICU, device options and steps, guidance modalities (bronchoscopy and ultrasound), anticoagulation/antiplatelet management, special populations (obesity, high ventilatory support, coagulopathy, ECMO/COVID), and emergency “can’t intubate, can’t oxygenate” (CICO) rescue with needle, surgical, or percutaneous cricothyroidotomy.

Learning Objectives

Distinguish PT vs surgical tracheostomy (ST) on setting, outcomes, and complication profile, and select the best approach for a given ICU patient.

Perform a structured pre‑procedure evaluation (anatomy, coagulopathy, ventilatory support, hemodynamics) and plan guidance (bronchoscopy ± ultrasound).

Execute a step‑by‑step PT with bronchoscopic confirmation, and manage common intra‑procedure issues (posterior wall contact, loss of airway, bleeding).

Recognize, prevent, and treat early and late complications of tracheostomy, including tracheo‑innominate fistula and tracheal stenosis.

Choose and perform the appropriate cricothyroidotomy technique for CICO; know age‑specific considerations and when to convert to tracheostomy.

Apply evidence on timing of tracheostomy, sedation/weaning implications, and decannulation workflows.

High‑Yield One‑Pager

PT vs ST: Overall complication rates are similar; PT has lower wound infection, shorter procedure time, and lower cost; bleeding is generally comparable.

Guidance: Bronchoscopic guidance improves first‑pass success and reduces complications; ultrasound adds value for anatomy/vascular mapping and may reduce major bleeding.

Puncture site: Between 1st–2nd or 2nd–3rd tracheal rings, midline, under bronchoscopy; keep ETT just below cricoid during puncture.

Coagulopathy: Aim for INR <1.5 and platelets >50 × 10⁹/L (transfuse if needed). If able, hold clopidogrel ≥5 days; PT can still be done with antiplatelet/anticoagulants in select settings with informed consent.

Ventilator settings: PT feasible even with higher PEEP; coordinate ETT retraction and minimize disconnections to preserve PEEP.

Obesity: Not a contraindication in expert hands; anticipate deeper trachea—consider extra‑long tracheostomy tubes.

Early complications: Subcutaneous emphysema (~1.4%), pneumothorax (~0.8%), bleeding, malposition; manage with bronchoscopy, tube exchange over a guide, and hemostasis.

Late complications: Tracheal stenosis (clinically significant 3–12%), tracheomalacia, tracheo‑innominate fistula (TIF <1%)—a surgical emergency.

Aspiration: Aspiration risk does not fall immediately post‑trach; cuff inflation does not prevent micro‑aspiration.

Weaning benefits: Tracheostomy reduces work of breathing and airway resistance; may shorten ICU stay and decrease sedation needs.

Timing: Evidence mixed; some analyses show no outcome difference, others favor earlier trach for more ventilator‑free days and shorter ICU stay—individualize.

CICO rescue: Adult default is surgical or percutaneous cricothyroidotomy; in children <10–12 y, prefer needle cricothyroidotomy with transtracheal ventilation.

Decannulation: Proceed after ventilator liberation with strong cough and secretion clearance; downsize → speaking valve → cap 48–72 h → remove; scope if intolerance.

Core Concepts
Pathophysiology / Epidemiology

Tracheostomy decreases upper airway dead space and resistance, lowering work of breathing; many patients tolerate reduced sedation and more aggressive weaning trials. These physiologic benefits, alongside improved comfort and communication potential, underpin its role in prolonged ventilation.

Indications & Contraindications

Indications (PT ≈ ST): bypass upper airway obstruction; anticipated prolonged ventilation; secretion management/aspiration reduction (supportive but not immediate).

Contraindications (contextual):

PT: True absolute is limited—safety depends on experienced operator and appropriate technique; many “relative” risks can be managed with preparation (e.g., obesity, high PEEP, prior trach, coagulopathy).

Practical red flags: active infection at site, unfavorable anatomy with unidentifiable landmarks, severe hemodynamic instability—consider deferral or ST.

Cricothyroidotomy: Primary CICO rescue in adults; avoid surgical cricothyroidotomy in children <~10 y—use needle technique with transtracheal ventilation. Elective cricothyroidotomy is selective and generally avoided after prolonged intubation or with laryngeal pathology due to subglottic injury risk.

Pre‑procedure Evaluation (PT)

Airway/anatomy: Palpate laryngeal landmarks; anticipate depth; consider ultrasound to locate thyroid isthmus, anterior jugular veins, pre‑tracheal vessels, and measure skin‑to‑trachea distance.

Ventilation/hemodynamics: Note FiO₂/PEEP, hypotension/vasopressors; PT can be performed at higher PEEP with caution; avoid in patients requiring multiple/high‑dose pressors.

Coagulation/medications: Target INR <1.5 and platelets >50 × 10⁹/L; hold heparin infusion ~3 h pre and resume ~2 h post; hold SC heparin/enoxaparin 12 h (BID) or 24 h (daily); hold clopidogrel ≥5 days if feasible (3–5 days for dual therapy). PT has been performed safely on antiplatelet/anticoagulants with higher minor bleeding but low major bleeding rates.

Consent/team: Clarify goals and alternatives; coordinate operator, bronchoscopist, RT, nurse, and bronch tech; complete checklist and maintain sterile field.

Equipment & Setup

Common kits include Ciaglia Blue Rhino (single tapered dilator), Griggs (GWDF) forceps dilatation, PercuTwist, and Blue Dolphin balloon. Prepare appropriately sized standard and extra‑long tubes; select bronchoscope compatible with ETT ID; infiltrate local anesthetic (e.g., lidocaine with epinephrine).

Step‑by‑Step Technique / Procedural Checklist (PT)

Position supine, shoulder roll, neck extended as tolerated; prep/drape.

Sedate/analgesia/paralysis as needed; suction airway; withdraw ETT cuff under bronchoscopy to just below the cricoid; reinflate cuff.

Incision: 1–1.5 cm vertical midline skin incision; blunt dissect to pre‑tracheal fascia; identify tracheal rings.

Needle puncture: Midline between 1st–2nd or 2nd–3rd rings under bronchoscopy; guidewire into trachea directed caudally.

Serial/single dilatation (e.g., punch dilator → single tapered dilator with sheath) or forceps dilation (Griggs).

Insert trach tube over dilator/sheath; advance into lumen; bronchoscopically confirm lumen and carina; keep distal tip ≥~1 inch above carina.

Ventilate and confirm with ventilator tidal volume and capnography; secure with ties/sutures.

Troubleshooting & Intra‑procedure Management

Posterior wall contact/false tract: Keep wire midline, caudad, and always under vision; if resistance or desaturation occurs, re‑scope and re‑establish ETT ventilation before reattempt.

Loss of airway in deep neck/obesity: Use extra‑long tube; consider airway exchange catheter and bronchoscopy for difficult re‑entries.

Bleeding: Apply local pressure/vasoconstrictor packing; if persistent, explore stoma; for sentinel hemorrhage or brisk bleeding days–weeks later, suspect TIF—hyperinflate cuff, apply digital anterior wall pressure, and emergent surgical control.

High PEEP dependence: Coordinate brief ETT withdrawal with minimal circuit breaks; consider a “PEEP‑dependency trial” if uncertain.

Post‑procedure Care & Follow‑up

Humidification, suctioning, inner cannula care, cuff pressure monitoring, and securement checks.

Decannulation after ventilator liberation, strong cough, manageable secretions: downsize → speaking valve → cap 48–72 h → remove; bronchoscopic assessment if capping failure.

Complications (prevention, recognition, management)

Early: bleeding; subcutaneous emphysema (~1.4%); pneumothorax (~0.8%); malposition/obstruction (especially with posterior wall apposition)—prevent with midline puncture, bronchoscopy, appropriate tube length; treat with hemostasis, bronchoscopy, and reposition/exchange.

Late: tracheal stenosis (clinically significant 3–12%); tracheomalacia (cuff‑related); TIF <1%; TEF (rare); stomal infection—minimize by correct ring level (between 1–3), cuff pressure control, and hygiene; TIF is surgical.

Special Populations

Obesity: Evidence supports safety with skilled operators; anticipate higher malposition risk; choose XLT tubes when skin‑to‑trachea distance is increased.

High ventilatory support/ARDS: PT feasible with higher PEEP; no consistent oxygenation deterioration when performed carefully.

Coagulopathy/antithrombotics: PT has been performed safely with elevated bleeding risk but low major hemorrhage; follow periprocedural hold/transfusion strategies. ECMO series report low major bleeding when heparin is paused.

COVID‑19: PT adopted widely with closed‑circuit modifications, associated with faster weaning and shorter ICU stay in series.

Cricothyroidotomy—pediatrics: Use needle cricothyroidotomy (<~10–12 y); avoid surgical techniques given small CT membrane and risk of laryngeal injury.

Evidence & Outcomes

PT vs ST: Meta‑analyses show similar overall complication rates, fewer wound infections, shorter procedural time, and lower cost with PT. Bleeding risk is comparable; tracheal stenosis risk is similar long‑term.

Timing of tracheostomy: Mixed data—some RCT meta‑analyses show no major outcome differences; more recent analyses favor earlier trach for ventilator‑free days, shorter ICU stay, and less sedation; timing should be individualized.

Bronchoscopy vs ultrasound: Bronchoscopy improves accuracy and reduces complications; ultrasound helps identify safe entry and may reduce major bleeding; randomized data suggest similar overall complication rates between bronchoscopy‑guided and ultrasound‑guided approaches in experienced hands.

Diagnostic & Therapeutic Algorithms
Algorithm 1 — Choosing PT vs ST (or Deferral)
flowchart TD
A[Patient needs tracheostomy] --> B{Landmarks & anatomy favorable?}
B -- No --> C[Consider ST / Adjuncts (US, rigid bronch) or defer]
B -- Yes --> D{Coagulopathy/antithrombotics?}
D -- Uncorrectable & high bleeding risk --> C
D -- Correctable or acceptable risk --> E{Vent/PEEP acceptable & hemodynamics stable?}
E -- Severe instability / multiple pressors --> C
E -- Stable or optimizable --> F{Operator & team experience + bronchoscopy available?}
F -- No --> C
F -- Yes --> G[Proceed with PT (bronch ± US)]


Bulleted algorithm (parallel):

Assess indication and bedside feasibility (palpable rings, neck extension).

If unfavorable anatomy or unstable hemodynamics, favor ST or defer.

Address coagulation (INR/platelets/transfusions; antiplatelet holds as feasible).

Confirm ventilatory optimization (manage PEEP, FiO₂); plan circuit strategy.

Proceed with PT under bronchoscopy; use ultrasound to map vessels/depth when helpful.

Algorithm 2 — Bleeding After PT (including TIF)
flowchart TD
A[Post-PT bleeding] --> B{Timing & severity}
B -- Immediate/oozing --> C[Local pressure, vasoconstrictor packing; correct coagulopathy]
B -- Persistent or brisk --> D[Explore stoma, cautery/suture; bronchoscopy to assess lumen]
B -- Delayed (days–weeks) or sentinel bleed --> E[Suspect TIF]
E --> F[Hyperinflate cuff; apply digital pressure at sternal notch (anterior wall)]
F --> G[Activate massive transfusion; emergent surgical consult]
G --> H[Definitive surgical repair]


Bulleted algorithm (parallel):

For minor oozing: pressure, packing (adrenaline/antifibrinolytic), correct coagulopathy.

For ongoing bleeding: explore stoma, identify/cauterize vessel; consider bronchoscopy.

Sentinel bleed or massive hemorrhage days–weeks later → TIF until proven otherwise: hyperinflate cuff, apply digital compression, and expedite surgical control.

Algorithm 3 — CICO: Emergency Surgical Airway (Adult vs Pediatric)
flowchart TD
A[Can't intubate, can't oxygenate] --> B{Age ≥ ~10–12 years?}
B -- Yes --> C[Surgical or percutaneous cricothyroidotomy]
C --> D[Ventilate; confirm CO2; secure; consider conversion if prolonged need]
B -- No --> E[Needle cricothyroidotomy + transtracheal ventilation]
E --> F[Urgent definitive airway (tracheostomy) when feasible]


Bulleted algorithm (parallel):

Declare CICO early; call for help, prepare surgical airway set.

Adults: perform surgical or percutaneous cricothyroidotomy via CT membrane.

Children <~10–12 y: perform needle cricothyroidotomy with high‑flow O₂; convert to tracheostomy promptly.

After stabilization, assess need/timing for conversion to tracheostomy based on duration and pathology.

Cases & Applied Learning
Case 1

A 55‑year‑old with COPD is intubated day 11. PEEP 8, FiO₂ 0.4. Platelets 58 × 10⁹/L, INR 1.4. On clopidogrel for a stent placed 18 months ago. Neck anatomy palpable.
Best approach?
A. Proceed with ST in OR for lower bleeding risk
B. Proceed with PT now under bronchoscopy, transfuse platelets
C. Defer trach; extubate then re‑intubate as needed
D. PT now without bronchoscopy
Answer: B. Anatomy and physiology are favorable; correct coagulopathy (platelets >50) and proceed with PT under bronchoscopy; clopidogrel ideally held ≥5 days but can proceed with precautions if non‑deferrable. Wound infection and time/cost favor PT.

Case 2

A 62‑year‑old with ARDS on PEEP 14 requires tracheostomy for prolonged ventilation. Hemodynamically stable on low‑dose vasopressor.
Next step?
A. Defer until PEEP ≤8
B. PT feasible with careful ventilator strategy and bronchoscopy
C. Must do ST because of high PEEP
D. Extubate to HFNC and avoid trach
Answer: B. PT is feasible at higher PEEP with meticulous ETT manipulation and circuit management; no consistent oxygenation decline when performed carefully.

Case 3

A 70‑year‑old day 21 post‑PT has a small “sentinel” bleed from the stoma that stops spontaneously.
Immediate action?
A. Schedule tube change tomorrow
B. Hyperinflate cuff and apply digital pressure; activate surgical pathway
C. Start antibiotics only
D. Deflate cuff to relieve pressure on mucosa
Answer: B. Treat as TIF until proven otherwise—cuff hyperinflation and anterior wall digital pressure are temporizing measures pending emergent surgical control.

Question Bank (MCQs)

Timing & Weaning
A 60‑year‑old on day 7 of ventilation (FiO₂ 0.5, PEEP 5) fails SBT (RSBI 130). What is the next best step?
A. Schedule ST now to reduce wound infection
B. Switch to SIMV to accelerate weaning
C. Schedule early trach solely to reduce mortality
D. Continue ICU care with daily SBT and reassess trach need
Answer: D. Early trach timing remains individualized; daily SBT with optimization is appropriate at day 7; evidence for mortality benefit is mixed.

PT vs ST Outcomes
Which statement is most accurate?
A. PT has higher overall complication rates than ST
B. PT reduces wound infection and procedure time vs ST
C. ST consistently has lower bleeding than PT
D. PT is more expensive than ST
Answer: B. Meta‑analyses show lower wound infection, shorter time, and lower cost with PT; overall complications and bleeding are similar.

Antiplatelets
Regarding clopidogrel and PT, the best statement is:
A. Must be stopped ≥3 days
B. Must be stopped ≥10 days
C. Prefer ≥5 days hold if feasible; PT can proceed with precautions if not
D. No need to consider antiplatelets
Answer: C. Aim for ≥5 days when possible; real‑world series show PT can proceed with informed consent and bleeding mitigation.

Coagulopathy Thresholds
For PT, a reasonable pre‑procedure target is:
A. INR ≤2.0 and platelets ≥20 × 10⁹/L
B. INR <1.5 and platelets >50 × 10⁹/L
C. INR <1.0 only
D. Platelets >100 × 10⁹/L mandatory
Answer: B. These pragmatic thresholds balance safety with feasibility.

Guidance Choice
Which is true about bronchoscopic guidance?
A. Increases posterior wall injuries
B. Decreases first‑pass success vs landmark technique
C. Helps confirm midline ring interspace and reduces complications
D. Contraindicated in obesity
Answer: C. Bronchoscopy confirms entry site and guidewire direction; trials show improved success and fewer complications.

Ultrasound Role
The strongest utility of ultrasound in PT is to:
A. Visualize the posterior tracheal wall
B. Map anterior vessels and measure skin‑to‑trachea depth
C. Replace bronchoscopy in all cases
D. Reduce total procedure time consistently
Answer: B. US maps vascular structures and depth; posterior wall is not seen; duration benefits are inconsistent.

Intra‑procedure Desaturation on High PEEP (Troubleshooting)
During PT on PEEP 16 and FiO₂ 0.6, oxygen saturation falls when the ETT cuff is deflated and retracted for puncture. Next best step?
A. Continue retracting—this is expected
B. Disconnect from ventilator and bag through the stoma
C. Re‑inflate the ETT cuff, re‑advance to re‑establish ventilation, then reattempt with minimal circuit breaks under bronchoscopy
D. Convert immediately to ST
Answer: C. Prioritize oxygenation; resecure the airway, then proceed with careful circuit management and bronchoscopy.

Obesity
In morbid obesity, a key preventive measure is:
A. Choose a smaller standard‑length tube
B. Avoid bronchoscopy
C. Use extra‑long trach tubes and consider US mapping
D. Always choose ST
Answer: C. Greater skin‑to‑trachea distance predisposes to malposition; XLT reduces cuff leak and malposition.

Aspiration
Which statement is true after tracheostomy?
A. Aspiration risk immediately disappears
B. Cuff inflation prevents micro‑aspiration
C. Aspiration risk may decrease only after several weeks
D. VAP risk is eliminated
Answer: C. Aspiration risk may diminish later; cuff inflation does not prevent micro‑aspiration.

Posterior Wall Contact—Troubleshooting
While dilating, the team suspects posterior wall tenting. Best action?
A. Advance quickly to minimize mucosal contact
B. Remove wire and blindly re‑pass
C. Re‑establish ETT ventilation, re‑scope, and reattempt with correct angle
D. Convert immediately to ST in the OR
Answer: C. Safety priority is to re‑secure ventilation and reorient the attempt under direct vision.

CICO—Age Considerations
During CICO in a 7‑year‑old, best initial invasive airway is:
A. Surgical cricothyroidotomy
B. Percutaneous cricothyroidotomy
C. Needle cricothyroidotomy with transtracheal ventilation
D. Emergency tracheostomy by non‑surgeon
Answer: C. The pediatric CT membrane is small; surgical techniques risk laryngeal injury—needle technique is preferred.

Delayed Bleeding
A day‑28 post‑trach ICU patient has sudden pulsatile bleeding from stoma. First move?
A. Deflate cuff to inspect
B. Hyperinflate cuff and compress anteriorly; activate surgical pathway
C. Replace the trach tube with smaller size
D. Observe; likely granulation
Answer: B. Treat as TIF—life‑saving temporization while mobilizing definitive surgical control.

Controversies, Variability, and Evolving Evidence

Timing: Early vs late tracheostomy remains debated; heterogeneity in populations and co‑interventions explains mixed outcomes.

Guidance modality: Bronchoscopy is widely favored for safety; ultrasound excels for prescan mapping; randomized data suggest non‑inferiority in experienced hands.

Antithrombotics: Ideal holds are often impractical in ICU; accumulating data support proceeding with mitigations when benefits outweigh risks.

Cricothyroidotomy conversion: Routine conversion to tracheostomy is not universally required; practice varies with anticipated duration and laryngeal status.

Take‑Home Checklist

Confirm indication, anatomy, team, plan (bronchoscopy ± US).

Optimize INR/platelets; coordinate anticoagulant holds as feasible.

Pre‑brief ventilator strategy; minimize circuit breaks; plan ETT retraction under vision.

Puncture midline between rings; keep wire caudad under bronchoscopy.

Choose tube length (XLT for deep trachea).

After placement, bronchoscopically confirm lumen and carina; verify ventilation.

Secure device and set up humidification/suction; monitor cuff pressure.

Watch for early bleeding/air‑leak; have a bleeding algorithm ready.

Educate bedside staff on TIF signs and immediate response.

Start a structured decannulation pathway once ventilator goals are met.
