Peripheral Biopsy Techniques: Conventional Sampling and Transbronchial Cryobiopsy
Exam Mapping & Scope

This chapter maps to the AABIP/IP board domains covering diagnostic bronchoscopy for central and peripheral pulmonary lesions and diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPILD). We synthesize technique selection, step-by-step performance, troubleshooting, safety, and evidence for: (1) conventional bronchoscopic sampling (forceps biopsy, brushing, washing, transbronchial needle aspiration [TBNA]) and (2) transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (TBLC) in ILD.

Learning Objectives

Choose the optimal sampling modality for central endobronchial, peripheral pulmonary, and hilar–mediastinal targets.

Prepare and perform forceps biopsy, brushing/washing, TBNA, and TBLC with attention to equipment, positioning, and specimen handling.

Anticipate and manage bleeding, pneumothorax, and oxygenation challenges; institute preventive measures (e.g., balloon blockers).

Apply anticoagulation/antiplatelet management and physiologic risk stratification for safe procedures.

Interpret factors that drive diagnostic yield (lesion size, bronchus sign, probe size and freezing time, number of samples).

Integrate TBLC into the ILD diagnostic pathway and recognize when to escalate to surgical lung biopsy (SLB).

High‑Yield One‑Pager

Central airway lesions: Forceps biopsy offers the highest single-tool sensitivity (~88%); brushing adds modest incremental yield (~8%) but is rarely diagnostic alone; washing adds little; TBNA excels for submucosal/peribronchial and necrotic targets.

Bleeding prevention & control: Pre‑identify risk (hypervascular lesions, anticoagulants). Keep epinephrine available (1:10,000, 2–3 mL aliquots, up to three doses), wedge the scope, and have a Fogarty balloon (4–7 Fr) ready for tamponade.

Anticoagulation: Platelets <50,000/µL—avoid biopsy; hold warfarin ~5 days or reverse to INR <2.5; stop clopidogrel 7 days; typical DOAC hold 48–72 h; aspirin can usually be continued.

Peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs): Fluoroscopy is the conventional guidance; TBNA often outperforms forceps/brush for malignancy, while forceps is stronger for benign disease; yield rises with lesion size and bronchus sign.

Sampling strategy (PPLs): Combine TBNA + forceps when feasible; target ≥6 specimens total across tools for best odds of diagnosis.

TBLC basics: Perform under general anesthesia via rigid or endotracheal tube; pre‑deploy bronchial blockers; fluoroscopy most common; freeze times typically ~6 s (2.4 mm probe) or ~8 s (1.7 mm). Aim for samples with largest diameter ≥5 mm.

TBLC yield & safety: Diagnostic yield ~80%; outpatient feasibility in ~80% of cases. Pneumothorax is the most frequent complication (reported 1–30%, pooled ~5%); major bleeding risk falls with routine blocker use.

TBLC risk factors: Higher pneumothorax risk with lower FVC, cystic/UIP patterns, multi‑lobe sampling, and general anesthesia; bleeding risk rises when sampling too central/far from pleura or near bronchiectasis/large veins.

Learning curve: Yield and efficiency plateau after ~50–70 TBLC cases; center volume matters.

When TBLC, when SLB: After noninvasive workup (including BAL) fails; TBLC first, SLB reserved when TBLC is non‑diagnostic or discordant.

Specimen handling: TBNA cell block and TBLC cores can support histology, immunohistochemistry, and molecular testing (including PD‑L1 for malignancy; pattern recognition for ILD).

Core Concepts
Indications & Contraindications

Conventional techniques

Forceps biopsy (central lesions): Visible mucosal tumors, inflammatory endobronchial disease. Limitations: submucosal disease, necrosis.

Brushing/washing: Adjunctive cytology; brushing sometimes detects cancer when biopsy is suboptimal; washing adds minimal unique yield.

TBNA (central + hilar/mediastinal + some PPLs): Submucosal or extrinsic compression, peribronchial disease, necrotic lesions, nodal disease. Contraindications mirror bronchoscopy; avoid vascular puncture sites and mucosa involved by tumor when staging to limit contamination.

TBLC

Indications: ILD/DPILD when CT + clinical + BAL are insufficient for confident diagnosis; transplant surveillance or selected critical‑care scenarios by experienced teams.

Absolute contraindications: Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia and hemodynamic instability.

Relative contraindications: FVC <50% predicted, DLCO <35% predicted, pulmonary hypertension (PAPs >40 mmHg), PaO₂ <55–60 mmHg, significant emphysema, rapid clinical/radiographic deterioration suggestive of AE‑ILD.

Pre‑procedure Evaluation

All techniques: History/physical, CT review (identify bronchus sign, vessels, emphysema/cysts), oxygenation and PFTs, coagulation profile if risk factors, consent addressing bleeding/pneumothorax and escalation (rigid bronchoscopy, SLB).

Antithrombotic management: Platelets ≥50,000/µL; hold warfarin (or reverse) to INR <2.5; clopidogrel stop 7 days; DOACs hold 48–72 h; aspirin often continued.

TBLC‑specific: Balloon blocker availability and placement plan; anesthetic plan (general anesthesia commonly with spontaneous ventilation support), fluoroscopy, rescue equipment, and post‑procedure imaging protocol (CXR or US if symptomatic or per institutional protocol).

Equipment & Setup

Forceps: Alligator or fenestrated; size choice by operator comfort; target 3–4 bites in central lesions (more rarely improves yield).

Brushes/washing: Disposable brushes; smear or saline agitation for cytology; microbiology when infection suspected.

TBNA: 21–22 G cytology needles; 19 G histology needles for cores; 4+ passes per nodal station improve yield; metallic sheath for peripheral reach; plastic sheath aids visualization of blood.

TBLC: Cryounit (CO₂ commonly used), disposable cryoprobes (1.1/1.7/2.4 mm); bronchial blockers (Fogarty 4–6 Ch or blockers through ET tube external channel); rigid tracheoscope or large ETT; fluoroscopy (CBCT/radial EBUS/other guidance optional).

Step‑by‑Step Technique / Procedural Checklist

Central forceps biopsy

Inspect; position scope close to lesion.

Open forceps just at lesion, advance, close firmly, withdraw; repeat for 3–4 samples.

If necrotic, sample until surface bleeding suggests viable tissue.

Brushing/Washing

Brush lesion before biopsy to avoid blood contamination when possible.

Prepare direct smears and/or saline rinse.

Washing (20 mL saline) before or after biopsy has similar yield; reserve for nondiagnostic cases (cost‑effective triage).

TBNA (central/submucosal/peribronchial and mediastinal)

Select puncture site from CT; anchor needle between cartilaginous rings.

“Pushing” method to enter perpendicularly; apply suction, perform to‑and‑fro motions ≤10 s.

4 passes per target; prioritize subcarinal/right paratracheal when applicable.

PPL sampling

Wedge into suspected segment; switch eyes to fluoroscopy.

Use TBNA first (less affected by bleeding), then forceps; consider brushing.

Aim ≥6 total specimens across tools.

TBLC

Intubate; place blockers (pre‑position Fogarty in target lobar/segmental bronchus).

Advance probe under fluoroscopy to pleura, then withdraw ~1 cm.

Freeze (typical: ~6 s with 2.4 mm, ~8 s with 1.7 mm; longer for 1.1 mm); remove bronchoscope + probe en bloc; immediately inflate blocker for tamponade.

Gently thaw sample off probe into formalin; repeat for 3–4 specimens (consider sampling two segments of the most affected lobe).

Troubleshooting & Intra‑procedure Management

Bleeding (central/PPL): Lateral decubitus bleeding side down; suction; cold saline; epinephrine (1:10,000) in 2–3 mL aliquots (≤3); inflate Fogarty; escalate to APC/laser through rigid bronchoscope if ongoing.

Bleeding (TBLC): Blocker inflation for 3–10 min; re‑check occlusion every 2–3 min; extend to 5–20 min if needed; consider diluted epinephrine; plan for rigid bronchoscopy if uncontrolled.

Can’t reach periphery (TBLC): Avoid taking central biopsies (risks bleeding, low alveolar tissue). Re‑approach another segment or lobe.

Low PPL yield: Re‑evaluate bronchus sign; reposition for true AP/lateral views; alternate tool order (TBNA first), and increase specimen count.

Post‑procedure Care & Follow‑up

All techniques: Observe for hypoxemia/bleeding; provide instructions for hemoptysis and pneumothorax symptoms.

TBLC: Post‑procedure imaging based on symptoms/local protocol (many centers image ~2–3 h if outpatient). Manage pneumothorax per standard algorithms.

Complications (Prevention, Recognition, Management)

Bleeding: Most common in central biopsy; prevention via risk review and blocker readiness; management as above.

Pneumothorax: ~0.2% after fluoroscopy‑guided TBLB for localized lesions; ~3% in diffuse disease sampling; TBLC pooled ~5% (range <1–~30%). Risk rises with more peripheral, near‑pleural TBLC—and with lower FVC, cystic/UIP patterns, multi‑lobe sampling.

Hypoxemia/bronchospasm: Optimize oxygenation; consider bronchodilators, brief procedure pauses.

Rare TBLC events: Tension pneumothorax, airway injury, pseudoaneurysm, transient opacities post‑transplant; acute exacerbation risk in fibrotic ILD underscores careful selection.

Special Populations

Ventilated/ICU: TBLC feasible in select centers with blockers and experienced teams; some series report acceptable safety without fluoroscopy in highly controlled settings.

Transplant recipients: Expect transient new opacities post‑TBLC; most resolve.

High bleeding risk: Prefer TBNA over forceps; for TBLC, use blockers routinely, avoid central/vascular areas; reassess indication if antithrombotics cannot be held.

Marked physiologic impairment: FVC <50%—heightened pneumothorax risk with TBLC; individualize approach.

Evidence & Outcomes

Conventional central sampling: Forceps ~88% sensitivity; brushing ~59% (adds ~8% when combined); washing ~48% with minimal exclusive positives; TBNA 68–91% and uniquely diagnostic in up to ~20% of submucosal/peribronchial cases.

PPLs: Conventional fluoroscopy‑guided approach overall ~78% sensitivity; size and bronchus sign are key predictors; TBNA excels for malignancy, forceps for benign disease; ≥6 specimens recommended.

TBLC in ILD: Diagnostic yield ~80%; good agreement with SLB for high‑confidence multidisciplinary diagnoses in rigorous studies; RCT strategy (TBLC‑first, SLB only if needed) reduces patient burden with similar overall diagnostic yield. Learning curves and center volume strongly influence both yield and safety.

Cases & Applied Learning

Case 1 — Submucosal Right Main Bronchus Bulge
A 69‑year‑old with hemoptysis has a smooth bulge without mucosal ulceration, CT showing a 2.5 cm right paratracheal node compressing the bronchus. Best initial bronchoscopic sampling strategy?
Answer: TBNA of the submucosal lesion. Explanation: TBNA penetrates deep layers/peribronchial tissue and provides high yield with less bleeding than forceps.

Case 2 — 1.7 cm Peripheral Nodule, Bronchus Sign Present
A 63‑year‑old smoker has a 17 mm LUL nodule with bronchus sign. After wedging and AP view alignment, your first tool?
Answer: TBNA. Explanation: Using TBNA first minimizes the impact of blood on cytology and is less affected by superficial bleeding; then add forceps.

Case 3 — Indeterminate ILD After HRCT + BAL
A 58‑year‑old with subpleural reticulation and no honeycombing remains unclassifiable after MDD. Next diagnostic step?
Answer: TBLC with pre‑placed bronchial blocker. Explanation: TBLC provides large, artifact‑sparing tissue samples with ~80% yield; blockers reduce major bleeding risk.

Question Bank (12 MCQs)

1. (Next best step)
A 72‑year‑old with a 3 cm right upper lobe mass and obvious endobronchial tumor undergoes forceps biopsy ×2 yielding necrosis. What is the next best step to maximize diagnosis?
A. Switch to washing only
B. Increase forceps bites until surface bleeding is seen
C. Perform brushing then stop
D. Abort and reschedule with EBUS
E. Proceed to percutaneous biopsy
Answer: B. Explanation: Necrotic tumors require deeper bites; sampling until surface bleeding often indicates viable tissue has been reached.

2. (Procedural troubleshooting)
During central forceps biopsy, moderate bleeding obscures the field. Which immediate maneuver most effectively prevents contralateral soiling?
A. Instill room‑temperature saline
B. Rotate to bleeding side down and keep suction at the lesion
C. Remove scope to re‑oxygenate
D. Inflate blocker in the opposite lung
E. Start vasopressors
Answer: B. Explanation: Lateral decubitus with the bleeding lung down plus continuous suction helps protect the non‑bleeding lung.

3.
For bronchoscopic staging of right paratracheal nodes, which factor most improves TBNA yield?
A. Using brushing first
B. Seven or more aspirates per station
C. Four aspirates per station
D. Avoiding suction to limit blood
E. Sampling tumor before nodes
Answer: C. Explanation: Yield improves up to about four passes per target; more than that offers marginal gains.

4. (Indications)
Which scenario most strongly favors TBNA over forceps biopsy as the primary tool?
A. Friable exophytic tumor with mucosal ulceration
B. Smooth submucosal bulge causing extrinsic compression
C. Diffuse endobronchial papillomatosis
D. Granulation tissue at stent edge
E. Suspected endobronchial infection
Answer: B. Explanation: TBNA penetrates submucosa/peribronchial regions and is ideal for extrinsic compression lesions.

5.
In fluoroscopy‑guided sampling of a 2.5 cm PPL with a clear bronchus sign, which tool sequence best preserves yield?
A. Forceps → TBNA → brushing
B. TBNA → forceps → brushing
C. Brushing → forceps → TBNA
D. Washing → forceps only
E. Forceps only
Answer: B. Explanation: TBNA first minimizes adverse effects of bleeding on subsequent cytology/histology.

6. (Complications)
Which TBLC maneuver most reduces major bleeding risk?
A. Taking central biopsies to avoid pleura
B. Prolonging freeze time to >12 s with large probes
C. Routine pre‑placement and inflation of a bronchial blocker
D. Avoiding fluoroscopy to shorten procedure time
E. Using washing to clear blood before removing probe
Answer: C. Explanation: Prophylactic blockers permit immediate occlusion of the target airway during and after specimen extraction.

7. (Contraindications)
Which patient characteristic most strongly argues caution or alternative to TBLC due to pneumothorax risk?
A. Normal FVC, cystic CT pattern
B. FVC <50% predicted without cysts
C. DLCO 40% predicted
D. Elevated BNP
E. Age >80 years
Answer: B. Explanation: Low FVC is associated with higher pneumothorax risk; cystic patterns also raise risk, but low FVC is a consistent red flag.

8. (Next best step)
A 64‑year‑old with suspected HP remains unclassified after HRCT and BAL. You plan TBLC. Which is the most appropriate procedural plan?
A. Conscious sedation, no blockers, single central biopsy
B. General anesthesia, near‑pleural sampling, 3–4 cores from ≥2 segments with blocker in place
C. Conscious sedation with washing only
D. One biopsy far from pleura to avoid pneumothorax
E. Percutaneous core biopsy of the lung
Answer: B. Explanation: Standardized TBLC emphasizes blockers, near‑pleural positioning, multiple adequately sized cores, often sampling two segments.

9.
For central airway biopsy in a patient on antithrombotics, which statement is most accurate?
A. Platelets 40,000/µL are sufficient if epinephrine is available
B. Warfarin need not be interrupted if INR <3.5
C. Clopidogrel should be stopped about 7 days pre‑procedure
D. All DOACs require a 7‑day hold
E. Aspirin must be held for 5 days
Answer: C. Explanation: Clopidogrel is typically held for ~7 days; many centers continue low‑dose aspirin; DOAC holds are generally 48–72 h.

10. (Procedural troubleshooting)
While performing TBLC, the probe repeatedly catches at a lobar carina and cannot reach the periphery. Best next step?
A. Take the biopsy at that level
B. Increase freezing time by 50%
C. Switch to another segment/lobe to obtain near‑pleural cores
D. Abort and schedule SLB
E. Inflate blocker and retry the same position
Answer: C. Explanation: Central biopsies risk bleeding and low alveolar content; reposition to obtain near‑pleural samples.

11.
Which factor most strongly predicts success of the conventional bronchoscopy approach to a small PPL?
A. Lesion SUV on PET
B. Bronchus sign on thin‑section CT
C. Presence of calcification
D. Patient age
E. Lesion density (ground‑glass vs solid) only
Answer: B. Explanation: A bronchus leading to/within the lesion is a key predictor of transbronchial diagnostic success.

12. (Complications)
Which statement about TBLC complications is most accurate?
A. Pneumothorax is rare and uniformly <1%
B. Major bleeding is common without blockers but uncommon with routine blocker use
C. Mortality is similar to surgical lung biopsy
D. TBLC cannot be done in an outpatient setting
E. Bleeding risk is lower when sampling far from pleura
Answer: B. Explanation: Major bleeding risk falls substantially with routine blocker use; pneumothorax rates vary across studies (pooled ~5%); outpatient performance is feasible in many centers.

Controversies, Variability, and Evolving Evidence

TBLC vs SLB concordance: High concordance for high‑confidence MDD diagnoses in rigorous frameworks, but variability persists across centers with lower volumes/experience.

Guidance for TBLC: Fluoroscopy is standard; some data support safe performance without guidance in select ICU settings, while advanced guidance (CBCT, CLE, radial EBUS) may improve targeting.

Probe size and freeze time: Larger probes increase sample size but may raise pneumothorax/bleeding risk if sampling too central; 1.1 mm probes are promising for discrete lesions, with evolving data in ILD.

Antithrombotic management nuances: Practices vary; general trends favor continued aspirin, time‑limited interruption of DOACs, and standardized thresholds for warfarin/platelets.

Take‑Home Checklist

Confirm lesion–airway relationship and plan the tool sequence (TBNA first for PPLs).

For central lesions, target 3–4 forceps bites; add brushing selectively; washing rarely diagnostic alone.

Pre‑position a balloon blocker for TBLC—and consider one even for high‑risk central work.

For TBLC, get near‑pleural cores (≥5 mm largest diameter) and consider sampling ≥2 segments.

Aim for ≥6 total samples in PPLs across tools.

Manage antithrombotics proactively (platelets ≥50k; hold clopidogrel; DOAC 48–72 h; warfarin to INR <2.5).

Control bleeding with position, suction, cold saline, epinephrine, and balloons; escalate early to rigid bronchoscopy if needed.

Monitor for pneumothorax post‑TBLC; have imaging strategy.

Use MDD to integrate histology with clinical–radiologic data.

Build experience: outcomes improve sharply after ~50–70 TBLC cases.
