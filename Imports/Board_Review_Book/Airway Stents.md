Exam Mapping & Scope

This chapter covers device selection, indications/contraindications, sizing and deployment, complication prevention/management, and special scenarios (post‑transplant anastomotic disease, tracheobronchomalacia, and aerodigestive fistulas). Emphasis is on practical, exam‑relevant decisions for malignant and nonmalignant central airway obstruction (CAO), including contemporary options (customized/3‑D printed and bioabsorbable stents).

Learning Objectives

By the end, learners should be able to:

Classify CAO as intrinsic, extrinsic, or mixed and choose an appropriate bronchoscopic/ stent strategy.

Select the right stent type (silicone vs covered self‑expanding metallic vs newer options) for malignant and benign disease.

Size, load, deploy, and remove silicone stents using rigid bronchoscopy; apply key measurements (diameter, length, margins).

Anticipate, prevent, and manage early/late complications (migration, granulation, mucus impaction, infection).

Manage special populations: post‑intubation/tracheostomy stenosis, transplant anastomotic disease, tracheobronchomalacia, and aerodigestive fistulas.

Interpret the current evidence (e.g., randomized data for stenting in malignancy; regulatory cautions for benign disease) and evolving technologies (3‑D printed, bioabsorbable, drug‑eluting devices).

High‑Yield One‑Pager (Pearls, Pitfalls, Exam Traps)

Classify the obstruction: intrinsic (endoluminal), extrinsic (compression), or mixed. Debulk intrinsic, stent extrinsic/mixed; reassess need after oncologic therapy.

Silicone is king in benign disease: removable, customizable, safer long‑term profile; avoid uncovered or partially covered metallic stents in benign disease.

Sizing rules that show up on exams: extend ~5 mm beyond both ends of the lesion; typical diameters—trachea 14–16 mm; mainstem 12–13 mm; bronchus intermedius 10–11 mm; slightly oversize when no rigid anchor (e.g., malacia, fistula).

Deployment: rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia is standard for silicone; measure length endoscopically; dilate before deployment; complete expansion with balloon or rigid instruments if needed.

Migration risk rises with under‑sizing or post‑therapy tumor involution; consider hourglass stents or external fixation when necessary; Y or Oki stents reduce migration at carina/primary right carina.

Mucus impaction kills: prevent with humidification and saline nebulization; ensure airway toilet plans post‑op; early bronchoscopic follow‑up.

Granulation at edges: minimize shear (good fit, gentle landing zones), treat with mechanical/thermal tools; exchange stent if recurrent.

TEF or BEF: airway stent first when double stenting is needed; beware pressure necrosis when both airway and esophageal stents are present.

Tracheobronchomalacia: use silicone stent as a trial to predict benefit before external surgical stabilization; long‑term permanent stenting for malacia is fraught with problems.

Transplant anastomosis: removable stents preferred; bifurcated silicone often needed when disease is close to secondary carinae.

SPOC RCT takeaway: therapeutic bronchoscopy improves dyspnea; stent arm reduces repeat bronchoscopies and sustains symptom relief longer.

3‑D printed/bioresorbable: promising for complex anatomy or temporary support, but not yet the default; choose standard devices for urgent palliation.

Cost note: silicone stents are substantially less expensive (on the order of 1.5–2× less than auto‑expanding metal devices).

Annual reassessment: plan annual evaluation and replacement for silicone stents if ongoing indication persists.

Exam trap: do not place a stent as first move in a chemo‑naïve, purely intrinsic malignancy if you can debulk and expect quick response to systemic therapy—use stent only when clinically necessary.

Another trap: pushing a silicone stent distally to reposition risks perforation—reposition proximally with rigid forceps instead.

Core Concepts
Pathophysiology / Epidemiology (brief, exam‑practical)

Central airways (trachea, mainstem bronchi, bronchus intermedius) fail from: (1) intrinsic tumor/ scar narrowing; (2) extrinsic compression by masses/adenopathy; (3) mixed disease. Additional structural failure includes malacia/polychondritis and anastomotic ischemia after transplantation. Fistulas (tracheoesophageal or bronchoesophageal; post‑resection bronchopleural) create contamination/aspiration risk and often require sealing plus airway scaffolding.

Indications & Contraindications

Indications (high‑yield five):

Counteract extrinsic compression from tumor/adenopathy.

Stabilize patency after debulking of endoluminal cancer.

Treat benign strictures (e.g., post‑intubation/tracheostomy, post‑transplant anastomotic).

Stabilize malacia/polychondritis (often as a temporary trial).

Seal fistulas (tracheoesophageal, bronchoesophageal; post‑resection stump dehiscence).

Contraindications (relative/strategic):

For intraluminal tumor, ablate/debulk first; stent only if needed.

Benign disease: use removable stents; avoid uncovered/partially covered metallic devices owing to fracture/ingrowth and difficult removal.

Nonfunctioning distal lung from extensive necrosis/cavitation: re‑expansion by stenting is unlikely to help.

Severe physiologic frailty may preclude benefit except for palliation of intractable dyspnea.

Pre‑procedure Evaluation (imaging, labs, risk, consent)

CT with thin slices; lung windows; measure minimal/normal diameters and lesion length; identify carina/secondary carina relationship.

Bronchoscopic assessment (flexible followed by rigid if intervening): classify obstruction; obtain tactile feel of rigidity; measure lesion length endoscopically.

Plan margins (~5 mm beyond proximal and distal disease).

Choose device based on indication, anatomy, expected reversibility (malignancy on therapy vs fixed benign), and removability needs.

Optimization: anticoagulation plan; airway clearance strategy; consent to include possible need for thermal/mechanical debulking, tracheostomy, or emergent airway maneuvers.

Equipment & Setup (practical details)

Rigid bronchoscope under general anesthesia for silicone stents (standard of care).

Dilation tools: rigid barrel dilation; balloons as needed.

Loading/Delivery: dedicated applicator for silicone; flexible or rigid techniques for covered SEMS; fluoroscopy as adjunct.

Stent options (non‑exhaustive):

Silicone straight, hourglass, Y (including Oki/right carina variants); radiopaque markers; customizable fenestrations.

Covered SEMS (nitinol) straight/Y; easier deployment; consider removability limits.

Specialty: customized (3‑D printed) silicone; bioabsorbable (polydioxanone) where temporary support is desired.

Step‑by‑Step Technique / Procedural Checklist (silicone focus)

Airway control with rigid scope; oxygenation strategy coordinated with anesthesia.

Debulk/dilate: remove intraluminal tumor; dilate stenosis with rigid barrel or balloon.

Size: confirm length/diameter intraoperatively; target 14–16 mm (trachea), 12–13 mm (mainstem), 10–11 mm (bronchus intermedius); slightly oversize for malacia/fistulas to reduce migration.

Load stent into the applicator; advance distal to lesion; deploy.

Position and expand: pull proximally into place with rigid forceps; complete expansion using balloon/rigid tube or forceps if incompletely opened. Avoid forceful distal pushing.

Ventilation strategy: fenestrate silicone (on table) for lobar orifices when needed (e.g., RUL with Y stents) or add distal limbs (Borgne technique).

Post‑deployment check: assess airway clearance, leak sealing (if fistula), and hemostasis.

Removal technique (when indicated): grasp proximal edge, rotate 360°, tuck 2–3 mm into the rigid bevel, and withdraw en bloc to protect larynx/vocal cords.

Troubleshooting & Intra‑procedure Management

Incomplete opening: balloon dilate or use rigid instruments to seat/expand.

Migration at deployment: reassess fit; choose hourglass or increased diameter; consider Y‑configuration for carinal disease; external fixation in select subglottic settings.

Fistula not fully sealed: look for residual side leak; upsize or add sealing rings/adjacent coverage; consider combined esophageal stenting (airway first).

Difficult anatomy (angulated/branched): consider customized/3‑D printed silicone; trial fit on a model when available (elective cases).

Post‑procedure Care & Follow‑up

Humidification and saline nebulization two to three times daily to reduce mucus impaction.

Early follow‑up bronchoscopy if heavy secretions or high‑risk edges; otherwise protocolized reassessment.

Annual reassessment and replacement for silicone stents if indication persists; earlier if complications.

Microbiologic surveillance is reasonable when colonization suspected; remove/replace stents impacted with infected secretions.

Complications (prevention, recognition, management)

Migration (~10% range): most often from under‑sizing or post‑therapy tumor shrinkage; manage by rigid extraction and refitting; hourglass design or fixation reduces risk.

Granulation (~8%) at edges: treat with mechanical/thermal tools; exchange if recurrent.

Mucus impaction (~3–4%): can be life‑threatening; emphasize humidification, airway clearance, early bronchoscopy for de‑obstruction.

Bacterial colonization: consider stent exchange if associated with refractory secretions.

Metallic‑specific: risk of fracture/ingrowth (especially uncovered/partial coverage) and difficult removal—avoid these in benign disease.

Special Populations

Post‑intubation/post‑tracheostomy tracheal stenosis (PITTS):

Simple web: often no stent; dilate or incise.

Complex cartilaginous: silicone preferred; migration risk increases near vocal cords; hourglass or fixation helpful. Longer dwell (up to ~18 months) associates with higher long‑term patency after removal than shorter dwell.

Lung transplant anastomotic disease:

Ischemia/scar common; removable stents favored; anticipate mucus, scarring, colonization; silicone Y often necessary when disease abuts secondary carinae; many patients can be decannulated from stents after healing.

Tracheobronchomalacia:

Reserve stents as temporary trials for symptom prediction before surgical external stabilization; straight silicone is prone to migration in flexible dyskinetic airways—size carefully.

Aerodigestive fistulas:

Malignant TEF/BEF: airway stent first; esophageal stent next if needed; beware pressure necrosis in double stenting.

Post‑pneumonectomy/ lobectomy stump fistula: surgery preferred; silicone stent is a temporizing/alternative option in nonsurgical candidates.

Evidence & Outcomes (selected)

Therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant CAO improves dyspnea; stents prolong symptom control and reduce re‑interventions in randomized and cohort data.

Covered nitinol SEMS are easier to deploy but carry different removal/ingrowth profiles than silicone; uncovered/partially covered devices are discouraged in benign disease.

Customized/3‑D printed silicone fit complex anatomy well with symptomatic/functional gains, but still show mucus/migration in a meaningful minority.

Bioabsorbable polydioxanone stents provide temporary scaffolding with promising early results; ongoing studies evaluate durability and ideal degradation profiles.

Controversies, Variability, and Evolving Evidence

Stent in chemo‑naïve malignancy: some centers defer unless airway instability persists after debulking; randomized data show symptom gains and fewer re‑interventions with stenting, but overall survival benefit remains uncertain.

Covered SEMS vs silicone in malignant CAO: easier deployment vs removability/customization trade‑offs; institutional experience matters.

Benign disease: strong preference for removable silicone; warnings persist against uncovered or partially covered metal devices.

3‑D printed/custom silicone: excellent fit for complex geometry yet nontrivial rates of mucus/migration remain; logistics/regulatory pathways can delay urgent care—temporary standard stent often used while customized device is built.

Bioabsorbable: attractive for temporary scaffolding (including post‑transplant), but optimal degradation kinetics and re‑stenosis risk require further study.

Drug‑eluting: promising for reducing granulation or delivering local antineoplastic therapy; clinical proofs are early.

Take‑Home Checklist (Operator’s Card)

□ Classify CAO (intrinsic/extrinsic/mixed) and treat intrinsic with debulking first.
