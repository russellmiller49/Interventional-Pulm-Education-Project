Rigid Bronchoscopy: Indications, Technique, and Troubleshooting

Exam Mapping & Scope
This chapter aligns with the AABIP IP Board Procedural Knowledge → Rigid Bronchoscopy/Foreign Body Retrieval domain. It consolidates contemporary indications and contraindications, anesthesia and ventilation strategies, step-by-step technique (including tumor debulking and foreign body removal), troubleshooting, complications, outcomes, and high-yield pearls for exam success and clinical practice.

Learning Objectives

Differentiate indications and contraindications for rigid bronchoscopy (RB), and select when RB is preferred over flexible bronchoscopy.

Choose anesthesia and ventilation strategies (TIVA, spontaneous-assisted vs jet) that optimize safety for the planned intervention.

Execute core RB intubation steps and the endobronchial debulking sequence (devascularize-core-coagulate base) and apply a competency checklist approach.

Manage massive hemoptysis, remove foreign bodies (including en bloc extraction), and treat benign stenosis (simple vs complex) using RB.

Anticipate, prevent, and manage peri-procedural complications and understand predictors of success and mortality from registry data.

High-Yield One-Pager

RB is the instrument of choice for acute central airway compromise (malignant or benign), massive hemoptysis, and complex foreign body (FB) extraction—owing to superior ventilation control, suction, ability to tamponade bleeding, and the capacity to pass large instruments.

Absolute contraindication: cervical spine instability. Relative contraindications: prior cervical fusion, hemodynamic instability, severe hypoxemia, coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia, and operator inexperience.

Anesthesia: RB is performed under general anesthesia. TIVA is preferred over inhalational agents because RB is an open system.

Ventilation: Spontaneous-assisted allows PEEP and closed-system monitoring; jet ventilation enables rapid FiO₂ reduction before thermal therapies but lacks airway pressure monitoring and carries barotrauma risk.

Technical success of therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction (CAO) is high (~93%). Dyspnea improvement is greatest with higher baseline symptom burden; lobar-only disease benefits less.

Predictors of success: endobronchial disease and stent placement increase success; ASA &gt;3, renal failure, left main disease, and TEF decrease success.

Complications overall ~3.9%; procedure-related mortality ~0.5%. Risks rise with urgent/emergent cases, ASA &gt;3, redo procedures, and the use of moderate sedation.

Thirty-day mortality reflects disease burden; associated with ASA &gt;3, ECOG &gt;1, intrinsic or mixed obstruction, and stent placement (especially Y-stent).

Debulking sequence: coagulate/devascularize → mechanical coring with the bevel → coagulate tumor base; stent when extrinsic or mixed obstruction or airway instability is present.

Benign stenosis: simple (mucosal) vs complex (cartilage). Simple—radial incisions + serial dilation; Complex—often requires stenting.

Foreign body removal pearl: grasp maximally and remove en bloc with the RB; inspect oropharynx if lost during extraction.

Core Concepts
Indications & Contraindications

Indications (illustrative): malignant or benign CAO, massive hemoptysis, complex FB removal, dilation of stenoses, stent placement, and facilitation of hot/cold ablative therapies. RB often serves as the platform for combined interventions (e.g., dilation + stenting; laser/APC + mechanical debulking).

Contraindications:

Absolute: cervical spine instability.

Relative: prior cervical fusion, hemodynamic instability, severe hypoxemia, severe coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia, operator inexperience.

When RB over flexible? Tracheal lesions, asphyxiating FBs, massive bleeding, and acute respiratory failure due to CAO—RB provides superior airway control, ventilation, and large-bore suction/instrumentation.

Pre-procedure Evaluation

Airway, imaging, and disease mapping: Define obstruction pattern (intrinsic vs extrinsic vs mixed) and distal patency to plan debulking and stenting.

Anesthesia & ventilation planning: Pre-oxygenate; agree on TIVA vs alternatives; choose spontaneous-assisted vs jet ventilation based on the need for thermal therapy and instrument throughput.

Risk stratification: ASA class and performance status (ECOG/Zubrod) correlate with complications and 30-day mortality in registry datasets.

Gap: Specific pre-procedure lab thresholds, anticoagulation/antiplatelet management, and antibiotic prophylaxis require local protocol or additional references.

Equipment & Setup

Rigid bronchoscope: stainless steel, straight, beveled, with distal fenestrations (bronchoscopes ~40 cm; tracheoscopes ~30 cm). Typical outer diameters ~9-14 mm; color-coded barrels; multiple proximal ports for ventilation and instruments.

Visualization: direct telescope or camera for video; flexible bronchoscope frequently used through the rigid tube for distal inspection, toileting, and adjunctive therapy.

Platforms: commonly used systems offer interchangeable barrels, universal heads, and integrated semi-flexible endoscopes that preserve lumen for suction and instruments.

Step-by-Step Technique / Procedural Checklist

Rigid intubation (core steps):

Position: partial head extension; protect teeth with finger/guard.

Insert midline with bevel anterior; pass under epiglottis; rotate 90° to traverse the cords into the upper trachea.

To enter a main bronchus, rotate the patient’s head toward the contralateral shoulder.

Use larger tracheoscope initially when needed; pass smaller barrels through it without re-intubation.

Use the flexible scope via the rigid tube for distal evaluation and clearance.

Competency tool concept (e.g., RIGID-TASC): Use a standardized checklist to assess basic RB skills. Trainees typically achieve competency after roughly 5-24 RBs (median ~15).

Tumor debulking (intrinsic or mixed):

1. Coagulate/devascularize, 2) mechanical coring using the distal bevel (“corkscrew/core-out”), 3) coagulate the base. Place a stent when residual extrinsic compression/instability is present or recurrence risk is high.

Foreign body extraction:

Choose smooth forceps for rounded FBs; alligator for sharp/irregular. Remove en bloc with the RB (scope + forceps + FB) to prevent loss. If lost during extraction, inspect oropharynx/larynx before re-intubation.

Troubleshooting & Intra-procedure Management

Massive hemoptysis: Intubate with RB, ventilate/protect the contralateral lung; tamponade with the scope itself; apply cold saline, APC, laser photocoagulation, or electrocautery as indicated.

Critical stenosis/difficult entry: Use smaller (pediatric) barrels, balloons, or guide the initial lumen with the flexible scope; then serially dilate.

Ventilation selection:

Spontaneous/assisted: closed system (pack leaks), allows PEEP/pressure monitoring but hypoxia can occur when instruments crowd the lumen.

Jet: frees the lumen, facilitates low FiO₂ for hot therapies, but airway pressures are not measured—iatrogenic pneumothorax is a risk.

Post-procedure Care & Follow-up

Expect rapid symptom relief when central airways are recanalized; benefits after debulking typically persist 2-3 months, and after stent placement ≈4 months (longer with effective oncologic therapy).

For endoscopically treated benign tumors, schedule surveillance bronchoscopy due to rare recurrence or malignant transformation.

Complications: Prevention, Recognition, Management

Rates: overall complications ~3.9%; procedure mortality ~0.4-0.5% in large series/registries.

Types: oropharyngeal/teeth injury, posterior membrane tear, hypoxia/hypercapnia, bleeding, pneumothorax, arrhythmia.

Risk factors for complications: urgent/emergent cases, ASA &gt;3, redo procedures, and moderate sedation (vs general anesthesia).

30-day mortality drivers: ASA &gt;3; ECOG &gt;1; intrinsic/mixed obstruction; stent placement—especially Y-stent (reflecting high disease burden).

Special Populations / Situations

Tracheo-esophageal fistula (TEF): Assess for airway compromise from bulky esophageal tumor. Stenting order is individualized; persistent fistula after optimal esophageal stent often necessitates double stenting (airway + esophagus).

Benign post-intubation/-tracheostomy stenosis: Simple vs complex dictates dilation alone vs stenting to stabilize cartilage.

Post-surgical/Transplant anastomoses: High-grade tight stenoses may require pediatric barrels or balloons first.

Gaps: Pregnancy-specific pathways, detailed anticoagulation reversal, and transplant-specific surveillance intervals are not covered here.

Evidence & Outcomes

Effectiveness: In multicenter registry data covering &gt;900 patients and &gt;1,100 procedures, technical success approaches ~93%; dyspnea improvement is greater with higher pre-procedure Borg scores and less in lobar-only obstruction.

Predictors of success: endobronchial disease and stent placement (↑ success); ASA &gt;3, renal failure, left mainstem disease, and TEF (↓ success).

Safety & anesthesia: Single-center series support the safety of TIVA with spontaneous-assisted ventilation in high-risk cohorts; procedure duration is a modifiable predictor of 30-day mortality.

Controversies, Variability, and Evolving Evidence

TEF stenting order: Whether to stent airway, esophagus, or both remains individualized. Many begin with esophageal stent unless airway compromise mandates airway stent first; persistent fistula often requires double stenting.

Ventilation choice: Centers vary between spontaneous-assisted and jet ventilation. Both are acceptable; jet offers faster FiO₂ reduction but sacrifices pressure monitoring.

Sedation strategy: Moderate sedation is associated with higher complication rates in RB but may still be used in limited contexts; TIVA is predominant.

Take-Home Checklist

Confirm indication and exclude absolute contraindications (cervical spine instability).

Align the team on anesthesia/ventilation (prefer TIVA; choose spontaneous-assisted vs jet case-by-case).

Prepare full RB tray: multiple barrel sizes, telescope/camera, coagulation device, cryo, dilators, stents, suction.

Intubation sequence: midline, bevel anterior, under epiglottis, rotate 90° across cords; head contralateral to enter a main bronchus.

Intrinsic tumor: devascularize → core → base; keep FiO₂ appropriate for hot therapies.

Extrinsic/mixed: dilate and stent for stability.

Massive hemoptysis: RB for airway control, tamponade, and topical hemostasis.

FB removal: choose forceps per shape; en bloc extraction.

Benign stenosis: classify simple vs complex; stent when cartilage involvement exists.

Anticipate complications; avoid moderate sedation; identify high-risk profiles (urgent cases, ASA &gt;3, poor performance status).
