Advanced Peripheral Bronchoscopy: Radial Probe, Electromagnetic Navigation, and Robotic Bronchoscopy
Exam Mapping & Scope

This chapter covers diagnostic approaches to peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs) using radial endobronchial ultrasound (rEBUS), electromagnetic navigation (EMN), and robotic‑assisted bronchoscopy (RAB). It aligns with AABIP IP Board domains on peripheral bronchoscopy indications, imaging/navigation, anesthesia/ventilation strategies, complications, radiation safety, and evidence interpretation.

Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, learners will be able to:

Select between rEBUS, EMN, ultrathin bronchoscopy, and RAB for specific PPL presentations.

Plan navigation using thin‑slice CT, interpret “bronchus sign” and “vessel sign,” and mitigate CT‑to‑body divergence (CTBD).

Execute stepwise registration, navigation, lesion confirmation, and sampling across platforms.

Interpret rEBUS patterns (concentric vs eccentric) and adjust tools/trajectory accordingly.

Apply anesthesia and ventilator strategies that reduce atelectasis and improve tool‑in‑lesion confirmation.

Anticipate, prevent, and manage bleeding, pneumothorax, and radiation exposure.

Critically appraise yield data and definitions and identify scenarios where adjunct imaging (augmented fluoroscopy, cone‑beam CT) adds value.

High‑Yield One‑Pager

Why bronchoscopy for PPLs? Lower pneumothorax risk than transthoracic routes and ability to combine diagnosis with mediastinal staging in one anesthetic.

Pre‑planning wins cases: Thin‑slice (&lt;1 mm) CT at near‑TLC; map the target’s airway generation; note bronchus sign and—if absent—follow the vessel sign (bronchovascular bundle).

CT‑to‑body divergence (CTBD) is the enemy: Expect more in lower lobes and with GA. Use recruitment maneuvers, PEEP 8-12 cmH₂O (as tolerated), and avoid high FiO₂ when safe.

Registration matters: Center the scope, avoid wall contact or buckling; confirm main carina alignment; complete platform‑specific sequences before navigation.

rEBUS patterns predict success: Concentric = tool centered in lesion; eccentric = adjacent; account for atelectasis mimics (look for air bronchograms).

Adjunct imaging fixes misalignment: Augmented fluoroscopy/tomosynthesis or CBCT can correct for CTBD and confirm tool‑in‑lesion.

Robotics extends reach and stability: Monarch and Galaxy (EMN‑based; continuous vision during sampling for both), Ion (shape‑sensing; vision probe removed during sampling).

Ultrathin scopes go distal: 3.0 mm OD / 1.7 mm channel reaches ~5th‑generation bronchi and accommodates rEBUS and mini‑tools.

Sampling strategy: Start with needle (creates tract if no bronchus sign), add forceps/brush; consider cryobiopsy when larger architecture is needed.

Complication profile: Pneumothorax rates with RAB are generally low; bleeding is usually mild-moderate and managed with wedging, cold saline, topical epinephrine, tranexamic acid, or tamponade balloons.

Radiation safety is part of the procedure: Use ALARA, pulsed fluoro, collimation; increase distance from the X‑ray source; wear eye/thyroid/torso protection.

Yield definitions vary widely: “Diagnostic yield” inflates when liberal definitions or follow‑up outcomes are included. Know the trial’s definition.

Common exam traps: Misreading atelectasis on rEBUS as tumor; trusting the virtual path over live endoscopic anatomy; failing to re‑register after major ventilator or patient position changes.

Core Concepts
Pathophysiology / Epidemiology

Pulmonary nodules are common on chest CT (on the order of one in five scans). Screening trials report high positive rates and demonstrated mortality benefits of CT screening, which drives more incident and screen‑detected nodules and the need for safe, accurate bronchoscopic diagnosis.

Indications & Contraindications

Indications: Diagnosis of solid/subsolid PPLs; integration with same‑session mediastinal staging; access to lesions beyond the reach of standard scopes; need to minimize pneumothorax risk relative to transthoracic biopsy; targeting for potential therapeutic interventions (e.g., ablation).

Contraindications: Gap: Not in provided materials.
(Use institutional standards for anesthesia, anticoagulation, and cardiopulmonary instability.)

Pre‑procedure Evaluation

CT planning: Thin‑slice (&lt;1 mm) inspiratory breath‑hold near TLC for optimal airway segmentation and pathway generation. Identify bronchus sign (airway to lesion) or vessel sign (paired artery indicating a likely accompanying airway when bronchus not visible).

Mental map: Document sequential airway branches and lesion position, anticipating software inaccuracies and CTBD.

Room setup: Fluoroscopy‑compatible bed; position robotic tower, bronchoscopy tower, anesthesia machine, C‑arm/CBCT; plan ROSE/specimen workflow; for EMN, clear metal from the field generator’s vicinity during registration.

Anesthesia/ventilation: GA with TIVA is preferred for guided peripheral procedures and robotics. Use recruitment maneuvers and PEEP 8-12 cmH₂O (hemodynamics permitting), and titrate FiO₂ to the minimum needed to maintain safe saturations to reduce atelectasis. Lower Vt with increased rate helps minimize airway motion.

Equipment & Setup (selected sizes/features)

rEBUS: ~1.4 mm probe; 360° imaging; recognize concentric vs eccentric vs atelectasis patterns.

Ultrathin bronchoscopy: ~3.0 mm OD with 1.7 mm channel; accommodates rEBUS and mini‑cryoprobe/needle; reaches more distal bronchi than thin scopes.

EMN platforms: Preplan pathway on thin‑slice CT; register with patient; steerable catheters/guide sheaths; modern systems integrate augmented fluoroscopy (e.g., tomosynthesis) to update lesion position intra‑operatively.

RAB platforms:

Monarch™: Telescoping sheath (6.0 mm OD) and inner scope (4.2 mm OD; 2.1 mm channel); continuous vision during sampling; EMN‑based hybrid tracking.

Ion™: 3.5 mm OD catheter with 2.0 mm channel; shape‑sensing; requires removal of vision probe for sampling; endoluminal compass for orientation.

Galaxy™: 4.0 mm single‑use scope with 2.1 mm channel; EMN‑based; integrated augmented fluoroscopy (TiLT) for real‑time CTBD correction.

Adjunct imaging:

Augmented fluoroscopy/tomosynthesis: Updates target location; supports “tool‑in‑lesion” confirmation.

CBCT (mobile or ceiling‑mounted) / O‑arm: Provides 3D intra‑op imaging; confirms tool‑target relationship; dose similar to low‑dose CT per spin in many protocols.

Step‑by‑Step Technique / Procedural Checklist

Pre‑op planning: Review CT; mark target; choose route favoring gradual branching; anticipate sharp turns and lower lobe motion.

Anesthesia & ventilation: Intubate with appropriately sized ETT (&gt;=8.0 mm when possible for robotics). Apply recruitment; set PEEP 8-12 cmH₂O; minimize FiO₂ while maintaining safety.

Airway inspection & clearance: Use a conventional bronchoscope to suction secretions judiciously (avoid inducing atelectasis).

Registration: Perform platform‑specific registration (carina alignment, contralateral bronchus passes, lobar/segmental mapping).

Navigation: Advance under live endoscopic view; keep scope centered; avoid buckling/airway wall trauma; use preview‑path features (where available).

Lesion confirmation:

rEBUS for pattern (concentric > eccentric) and depth; beware atelectasis mimics (air bronchograms).

Use augmented fluoroscopy or CBCT to correct CTBD and confirm tool‑in‑lesion.

Sampling: Start with needle (creates tract when no bronchus sign), then forceps ± brush; consider cryobiopsy for architecture, especially subsolid lesions. Use ROSE to guide passes (often 3-4 needle passes before switching tools).

Troubleshooting: If collapse blocks progress, inject small aliquots of air via the working channel to stent distal airways; re‑recruit and re‑register after major changes.

Hemostasis/readiness: Keep epinephrine, tranexamic acid, and tamponade balloons available; wedge the sheath in the most distal airway to confine any bleeding.

Post‑procedure: Ventilator parameters back to baseline; monitor for pneumothorax/bleeding; adhere to radiation‑safety doffing and dose recording.

Troubleshooting & Intra‑procedure Management

CTBD: Expect larger divergence in lower lobes. Re‑acquire tomosynthesis or CBCT; adjust scope trajectory; repeat recruitment; ensure consistent ventilator settings throughout imaging and sampling.

Atelectasis misreads on rEBUS: Look for hyperechoic air bronchograms and uniform patterns that suggest collapse rather than tumor.

Distal airway collapse: Use small air injections (e.g., ~20 mL) via working channel to splint open; avoid saline if image quality for rEBUS/CBCT is critical.

Scope instability during sampling: For telescoping systems, “park” the sheath segmentally; advance the inner scope or tools over a visible guide.

EMN interference: Remove metal from field; verify sensor integrity; consider re‑registration if the C‑arm or table position changed substantially.

Post‑procedure Care & Follow‑up

Observe for hypoxia, bleeding, and pneumothorax; chest imaging per institutional protocol and clinical suspicion. Ensure pathology/ROSE communication and plan for follow‑up or repeat sampling if initial results are non‑diagnostic under strict definitions.

Complications (prevention, recognition, management)

Bleeding: Wedge position; cold saline; topical epinephrine (0.1 mg/mL × 4 mL); tranexamic acid (250-500 mg); endoballoon tamponade when needed. Escalate to a therapeutic bronchoscope if necessary while preserving airway control.

Pneumothorax: Low incidence with RAB; wedge sheath distally; maintain PEEP prudently; consider small saline instillation at the end to reduce air leak risk.

Radiation: Follow ALARA; pulsed fluoro; tight collimation; maximize distance from the source; wear protective aprons, thyroid shields, and lead glasses.

Special Populations / Situations

Lower lobe lesions / high BMI / long cases: Anticipate more CTBD and atelectasis; consider lateral decubitus positioning (target side up) when mobile CT is used to mitigate dependent collapse.

Altered anatomy (post‑resection): Some systems allow partial registration limited to remaining lobes.

Emphysema with collapsible airways: Airway stenting with air injections and careful PEEP titration can facilitate distal navigation.

Subsolid/ground‑glass lesions: Often not visible on fluoro; rely on CBCT confirmation and consider cryobiopsy for histoarchitecture.

Evidence & Outcomes (selected signals for exam thinking)

rEBUS overall yield ~70%, with higher yields for concentric versus eccentric views; robotic visualization may mitigate the gap in some series.

Large EMN cohorts show improved yields when combined with rEBUS and augmented imaging; modern EMN with tomosynthesis achieved non‑inferior diagnostic yield to CT‑guided transthoracic biopsy in randomized data, with far lower pneumothorax rates.

RAB platforms demonstrate high navigational success with low complication rates; prospective and multicenter data show yields commonly in the mid‑70s to mid‑80s range when paired with rEBUS and/or 3D imaging.

Definitions matter: strict vs liberal yield definitions can shift reported yield by &gt;20 percentage points; recent consensus statements standardize reporting.

Cases & Applied Learning

Case 1. A 64‑year‑old woman with a 14 mm RLL nodule and no bronchus sign is scheduled for RAB. Under GA, rEBUS shows no signal at the virtual target.
What’s the next best step?
A. Increase FiO₂ to 100% and reattempt rEBUS
B. Perform blind forceps biopsy
C. Perform recruitment and PEEP optimization, then tomosynthesis to update target
D. Abandon bronchoscopy and schedule transthoracic biopsy
E. Switch immediately to cryobiopsy
Answer: C. CTBD and atelectasis are common in lower lobes under GA. Recruitment/PEEP and tomosynthesis can realign target and confirm tool‑in‑lesion before sampling.

Case 2. A 53‑year‑old man with a 10 mm mixed GGO in RUL undergoes Ion‑based RAB. Lesion not seen on fluoro; rEBUS is equivocal.

A. Two‑plane conventional fluoroscopy
B. CBCT with breath‑hold and then cryobiopsy
C. Increase suction to improve rEBUS image
D. Escalate to rigid bronchoscopy
E. Abort procedure
Answer: B. Subsolid lesions are often fluoro‑invisible; CBCT provides 3D confirmation and supports cryobiopsy for architecture.

C. Pneumothorax rates are generally low; wedging and stable platforms may reduce risk
D. Radiation is negligible, so shielding is optional
E. RAB cannot be used with CBCT
Answer: C.

Controversies, Variability, and Evolving Evidence

Does robotics improve yield over state‑of‑the‑art EMN? Comparative data suggest similar diagnostic yields when EMN is combined with tomosynthesis, though robotics may confer advantages in reach, stability, and tool control.

How much do adjunct imaging modalities improve outcomes? They reliably correct CTBD and confirm tool‑in‑lesion, but the incremental effect on diagnostic yield varies across studies and depends on definitions and case mix.

What is the optimal sampling toolset? Needles and forceps remain foundational; cryobiopsy is promising for subsolid lesions but adds cost and bleeding considerations.

Yield definitions: Without standardized definitions, headline numbers are not comparable; recent consensus aims to harmonize reporting across studies.
