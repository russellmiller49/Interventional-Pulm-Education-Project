reatment Options for Early‑Stage Lung Cancer

Target audience: IP fellows and practicing pulmonologists

Exam Mapping & Scope

This chapter covers the contemporary management of resectable and medically inoperable stage I-II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), aligned to AABIP board domains: (1) patient selection and pre‑operative evaluation; (2) surgical options (lobectomy, segmentectomy, wedge; minimally invasive approaches; nodal assessment); (3) stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT); (4) perioperative systemic therapy (neoadjuvant, adjuvant, peri‑adjuvant immunotherapy; adjuvant targeted therapy); (5) image‑guided ablation; (6) complications and surveillance.

Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, learners will be able to:

Select surgery, SBRT, or ablation for stage I-II NSCLC based on tumor and patient factors.

Apply physiologic algorithms (FEV₁/DLCO and predicted postoperative values) to determine operability and the need for additional testing.

Choose between lobectomy and sublobar resection for small peripheral tumors and describe nodal staging strategies.

Integrate perioperative immunotherapy and adjuvant targeted therapy in appropriate molecularly defined subgroups.

Anticipate, prevent, and manage key complications of surgery, SBRT, and thermal ablation.

Construct surveillance plans after definitive local therapy and recognize patterns of failure and salvage options.

High‑Yield One‑Pager (Pearls, Pitfalls, Traps)

Staging drives therapy. Stage I-II NSCLC is potentially curable; ensure accurate mediastinal assessment before definitive treatment.

Operability is two‑part: (1) oncologic resectability; (2) physiologic candidacy by FEV₁/DLCO and predicted postoperative values; borderline results trigger exercise testing.

Surgery is standard for operable patients. Lobectomy remains default; segmentectomy is acceptable for carefully selected &lt;=2 cm peripheral cT1N0 lesions with thorough nodal assessment.

More central tumors: consider sleeve resection to avoid pneumonectomy when feasible.

Nodal management: at least lobe‑specific systematic sampling; routine complete mediastinal dissection has not consistently improved OS when prior sampling is negative.

SBRT is preferred definitive therapy for medically inoperable peripheral stage I tumors; excellent local control; pneumonitis risk rises with central lesions.

PORT (postoperative radiation): not indicated after complete (R0) resection of stage I-II; indicated for positive margins (R1).

Perioperative immunotherapy: Neoadjuvant chemo‑IO improves event‑free survival and pathologic complete response (pCR); peri‑adjuvant (neo + adjuvant) strategies further improve EFS in resectable stage II-III patients without targetable drivers.

Adjuvant IO after chemo benefits resected stage II-IIIA (PD‑L1-enriched benefit varies by regimen).

Targeted adjuvant therapy: Osimertinib (EGFR 19del/L858R) and alectinib (ALK) improve DFS after resection.

Ablation (RFA/MWA/cryo): option for high‑risk or oligometastatic settings; cryo favored near critical structures; pneumothorax is common and manageable.

Elderly/frail patients: sublobar resection or SBRT are reasonable; decisions individualized.

Common traps: overtreating indolent ground‑glass lesions, under‑staging mediastinum, giving PORT after R0 stage I-II, and missing EGFR/ALK testing before committing to immunotherapy plans.

Core Concepts
Pathophysiology / Epidemiology

Early‑stage NSCLC comprises about one‑third of new NSCLC, largely adenocarcinoma and squamous subtypes. Five‑year survival declines with stage; accurate TNM staging (current IASLC/AJCC edition) is essential for selecting curative modalities.

Indications & Contraindications

Surgery: Operable cT1-2N0-1 disease; contraindications include prohibitive cardiopulmonary risk or diffuse metastatic disease.

SBRT: Medically inoperable or surgery‑declining patients with peripheral lesions; caution for central tumors.

Ablation: High surgical risk, prior high‑dose RT field, or oligometastatic/oligoprogressive settings when complete local control of all sites is feasible.

Perioperative systemic therapy:

Neoadjuvant chemo‑IO: Resectable stage II-III (and select IB &gt;=4 cm) without EGFR/ALK alterations.

Adjuvant IO: Resected stage II-IIIA (PD‑L1‑dependent benefit varies).

Adjuvant targeted: EGFR 19del/L858R (osimertinib), ALK (alectinib).

PORT: R1 resections; not for routine R0 stage I-II.

Pre‑procedure Evaluation (Imaging, Labs, Risk, Consent)

Imaging: Thin‑slice CT chest; PET‑CT for staging; consider brain MRI in &gt;=stage II.

Mediastinal evaluation: EBUS‑TBNA for suspicious nodes or tumors &gt;3 cm/central; surgical staging as needed.

Pulmonary physiology: Obtain FEV₁ and DLCO in all surgical candidates. If either &lt;80% predicted, calculate predicted postoperative (ppo) FEV₁/DLCO using segment counting or split‑function perfusion; borderline results prompt cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET).

Antithrombotics: Follow institutional bridging for neuraxial anesthesia and VATS; coordinate with cardiology for stents.

Consent: Include risks specific to chosen modality (air leak, atrial arrhythmia, pneumonitis, pneumothorax, BPF, hemoptysis).

Equipment & Setup

Surgery: VATS or RATS platforms with endoscopic staplers, energy devices; availability for sleeve resection; mediastinal nodal instruments.

SBRT: Immobilization devices, 4D‑CT simulation, image guidance (cone‑beam); motion management (breath‑hold, gating).

Ablation:

RFA: Single/cluster electrodes (2-5 cm ablation zones), temperature monitoring; saline infusion or cooled tips for larger lesions.

MWA: 900-2500 MHz antennas; allows larger, faster ablations; multiple antennas for &gt;=3 cm.

Cryoablation: Multiple cryoprobes spaced &lt;=2 cm, typical triple‑freeze cycles; clear ice‑ball visualization; general anesthesia recommended for central lesions to ensure airway control.

Step‑by‑Step Technique / Procedural Checklist

Lobectomy/Segmentectomy (VATS/RATS)

Confirm side, stage, and plan; ensure complete pre‑op nodal workup.

Port placement; adhesiolysis.

Fissure‑last or fissure‑first strategy per anatomy; isolate vein, artery, bronchus.

Parenchymal division with staplers; oncologic margins confirmed.

Nodal assessment: Hilar and mediastinal (lobe‑specific systematic); submit for pathology.

Air‑leak test; hemostasis; chest tube placement.

SBRT

Simulation (4D‑CT); define ITV/PTV with motion margins.

Dose/fractionation per site, size, and proximity to OARs; verify constraints.

Daily image guidance; manage cough and respiration.

Post‑therapy toxicities counseling (cough, fatigue, radiation pneumonitis).

Percutaneous Ablation

Planning CT, trajectory avoiding bullae and vessels; consent includes pneumothorax risk.

Analgesia: moderate sedation for peripheral lesions; general anesthesia for central/bleeding risk; consider double‑lumen ventilation for airway protection.

Device placement:

RFA/MWA: position electrode/antenna centrally first, then peripheral passes for coverage.

Cryo: position multiple probes; perform freeze‑thaw cycles; monitor ice‑ball margins (&gt;=5-10 mm beyond tumor).

Post‑ablation CT; track cautery if needed; observe for pneumothorax; plan chest tube if symptomatic or large.

Troubleshooting & Intra‑procedure Management

Dense hilar fibrosis (post‑neoadjuvant IO): Convert to thoracotomy early; obtain proximal control; be prepared for sleeve reconstruction.

Persistent air leak: Buttress staple lines; pleural tent; consider autologous blood patch post‑op.

SBRT motion: Escalate motion control (gating/abdominal compression); re‑plan if motion &gt;1 cm.

Ablation near critical structures: Prefer cryo; use intentional small pneumothorax/hydrodissection to displace OARs; watch for hemoptysis.

Post‑procedure Care & Follow‑up

Surgery: Early ambulation, pulmonary hygiene; remove chest tube when no air leak and acceptable drainage; pathology‑driven adjuvant decisions.

SBRT/Ablation: Short‑term imaging for pneumonitis or inflammatory change; serial CT at 3, 6, 12 months, then per surveillance schedule.

Surveillance (after curative therapy): History/physical and chest CT every 6 months for 2 years, then annually; counsel smoking cessation.

Complications (Prevention, Recognition, Management)

Surgery: Prolonged air leak, pneumonia, atrial arrhythmias, VTE; mitigate via enhanced recovery, pain control, early mobilization.

SBRT: Fatigue, dermatitis, esophagitis (central lesions), radiation pneumonitis—treat with corticosteroids and supportive care.

Ablation: Pneumothorax (frequent; drain if symptomatic/large), perilesional hemorrhage, bronchopleural fistula (lower with cryo than heat‑based), hemoptysis, rare systemic air embolism, pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm (urgent IR/surgical management).

Special Populations

Severe COPD/poor reserve: Prefer SBRT or sublobar resection; ablation for select lesions.

Elderly/frail: Individualize; segmentectomy/SBRT often appropriate with comparable disease control for small peripherally located tumors.

Driver‑positive tumors (EGFR/ALK): Favor adjuvant targeted therapy after resection; perioperative immunotherapy is generally avoided in these subgroups.

Anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy: Coordinate per procedure; manage bleeding risk for ablation and neuraxial anesthesia.

Evidence & Outcomes (Key Trials/Effects)

Surgery vs sublobar: Contemporary randomized data support segmentectomy equivalence to lobectomy for &lt;=2 cm peripheral cT1N0 lesions, with small increases in locoregional relapse but preserved lung function.

SBRT: Phase II/III data show ~90% local control for small peripheral tumors; improved quality of life versus conventional RT; pooled randomized data suggest comparable OS to surgery in selected operable patients but limited by small accrual.

Neoadjuvant chemo‑immunotherapy (CheckMate 816): Improved event‑free survival and pCR (~24% vs ~2%), without excess surgical morbidity; peri‑adjuvant strategies (KEYNOTE‑671, AEGEAN, CheckMate 77T) further increase EFS and pCR.

Adjuvant immunotherapy (IMpower010, PEARLS/KEYNOTE‑091): DFS benefit after platinum‑based chemotherapy; magnitude varies by PD‑L1 and regimen.

Adjuvant targeted therapy: Osimertinib (EGFR 19del/L858R) and alectinib (ALK) demonstrate substantial DFS benefits in resected stage IB-IIIA disease.

Cases & Applied Learning

Case 1 (Next Best Step).
A 68‑year‑old with 35‑pack‑years has a 1.8 cm peripheral LLL adenocarcinoma (cT1bN0), FEV₁ 82%, DLCO 78%, PET‑negative mediastinum. EGFR/ALK negative.
A. SBRT
B. Wedge resection
C. Anatomic segmentectomy with lobe‑specific nodal sampling
D. Lobectomy
E. Neoadjuvant chemo‑IO then surgery
Answer: C. For &lt;=2 cm peripheral cT1N0 with adequate reserve, segmentectomy with rigorous nodal assessment offers oncologic equivalence to lobectomy while preserving lung. Neoadjuvant chemo‑IO is reserved for higher‑risk stages.

Case 2 (Troubleshooting).
During VATS right upper lobectomy after neoadjuvant chemo‑IO for cN1 disease, dense hilar fibrosis obscures the pulmonary artery.
A. Persist with VATS dissection
B. Convert to thoracotomy and obtain proximal PA control
C. Abort and give PORT
D. Proceed directly to pneumonectomy
E. Apply topical thrombin and continue
Answer: B. Early conversion with proximal control mitigates vascular risk in treatment‑related fibrosis; sleeve or standard lobectomy can still achieve R0.

Case 3 (Complication Recognition).
A 76‑year‑old medically inoperable patient receives SBRT to a peripheral RLL lesion. Four weeks later presents with dry cough, low‑grade fever, and new ground‑glass opacity within the high‑dose region.
A. Bacterial pneumonia—start antibiotics only
B. Radiation pneumonitis—start oral steroids and supportive care
C. Pulmonary embolism—anticoagulate
D. Heart failure—diurese
E. Disease progression—start systemic therapy
Answer: B. Timing and imaging confined to the irradiated field are classic for radiation pneumonitis.

Case 4 (Next Best Step).

A. Adjuvant pembrolizumab
B. Adjuvant atezolizumab
C. Observation only
D. Adjuvant osimertinib
E. PORT
Answer: D. Adjuvant osimertinib improves DFS in EGFR 19del/L858R resected disease. PORT is not indicated after R0 margins in stage II without other indications.

A. Neoadjuvant chemo‑IO then lobectomy
B. SBRT
C. Wedge resection under epidural only
D. PORT
E. Observation
Answer: B. SBRT is preferred for medically inoperable peripheral stage I.

Which statement about segmentectomy is TRUE for &lt;=2 cm peripheral cT1N0?
A. Always inferior OS vs lobectomy
B. Improves OS but doubles local recurrence
C. Non‑inferior disease‑free survival, small increase in locoregional relapse, preserves function
D. Requires no nodal sampling
E. Only for GGO‑predominant lesions
Answer: C. Modern randomized data show equivalence with careful nodal assessment; function is better preserved.

Controversies, Variability, and Evolving Evidence

Segmentectomy scope: While RCTs support segmentectomy for &lt;=2 cm peripheral lesions, locoregional relapses are modestly higher; meticulous nodal work and margins are critical.

SBRT vs surgery in operable patients: Pooled randomized data are limited; retrospective series favor surgery for cancer‑specific mortality, yet SBRT has lower early mortality—shared decision‑making is key.

Peri‑ vs adjuvant immunotherapy: Peri‑adjuvant regimens yield greater EFS gains than neoadjuvant alone, but optimal patient selection, PD‑L1 thresholds, and duration remain under study.

ctDNA and pathologic response as surrogates: Clearance and pCR correlate with EFS/OS, but are not yet universally used to omit or tailor adjuvant therapy.

Ablation role: Expanding in oligometastatic/oligoprogressive disease; comparative effectiveness vs SBRT continues to evolve.

Take‑Home Checklist

☐ Confirm stage and mediastinal status before definitive therapy.

☐ Measure FEV₁/DLCO for all surgical candidates; compute ppo if &lt;80%.

☐ For &lt;=2 cm peripheral cT1N0, consider segmentectomy with thorough nodal assessment.

☐ Use SBRT for medically inoperable peripheral stage I; mind central constraints.

☐ Do not give PORT after R0 stage I-II resection; do give for R1.

☐ Test for EGFR/ALK in resectable disease; integrate osimertinib/alectinib when indicated.

☐ Consider neoadjuvant chemo‑IO (and peri‑adjuvant platforms) for stage II-III without targetable drivers.

☐ Anticipate fibrosis with neoadjuvant IO; convert early for safe vascular control.

☐ Recognize SBRT pneumonitis; treat promptly with steroids.

☐ In ablation, plan for pneumothorax; use cryo near critical structures.

☐ Surveillance CT every 6 months × 2 years, then annually; reinforce smoking cessation.
