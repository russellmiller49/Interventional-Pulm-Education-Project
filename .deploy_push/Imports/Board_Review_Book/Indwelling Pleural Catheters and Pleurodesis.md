ndwelling Pleural Catheters and Pleurodesis
Exam Mapping & Scope

This chapter targets the AABIP IP Board domains on pleural disease: malignant and non‑malignant pleural effusions, tunneled/indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs), medical pleurodesis (talc slurry and poudrage), outpatient pathways, infection recognition/management, intrapleural enzyme therapy, and complications.

Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, IP fellows and practicing pulmonologists will be able to:

Differentiate indications for IPC, talc pleurodesis, combined strategies, and surgical approaches in malignant pleural effusion (MPE) and selected non‑malignant pleural effusions (NMPE).

Select the next best step for patients with trapped lung, high symptom burden, limited life expectancy, or prior pleurodesis failure.

Recognize, diagnose, and manage IPC infections and distinguish infection from colonization.

Execute step‑by‑step techniques for IPC insertion and talc pleurodesis, including peri‑procedural analgesia and chest tube management.

Troubleshoot non‑draining IPCs, loculations, and post‑pleurodesis pain; deploy intrapleural enzyme therapy (IET) when appropriate.

Anticipate, prevent, and manage complications (empyema, ARDS with non‑graded talc, catheter‑tract metastasis, loculations).

Apply high‑yield trial evidence (e.g., TIME2, AMPLE, IPC‑PLUS, TAPPS, ASAP, OPTIMUM) to exam cases.

High‑Yield One‑Pager

Most testable facts and common traps

IPC vs talc pleurodesis for MPE: Both improve dyspnea similarly early; IPC pathways reduce hospital days and reinterventions. At ~6 months, some studies show a dyspnea advantage with IPC and fewer inpatient days overall.

Talc delivery: Talc slurry via tube and talc poudrage via thoracoscopy have comparable pleurodesis failure at 90 days; complication rates are similar. The long‑held superiority of poudrage is not supported by contemporary RCTs.

Combined strategies: Talc instilled through an IPC increases pleurodesis success versus IPC alone; ambulatory “rapid pleurodesis” protocols (thoracoscopic poudrage + IPC) achieve high success in case series.

Aggressive IPC drainage: Daily drainage accelerates autopleurodesis and increases its rate versus alternate‑day schedules.

IPC infection basics: Overall IPC infection risk is ~5–6%. Staphylococcus aureus predominates in deep infections; coagulase‑negative staphylococci often indicate colonization. Culture‑negative infections occur.

Diagnosing IPC infection: New fever, pain, cellulitis/tunnel erythema, purulent drainage, or cloudy/purulent pleural fluid with low pH/glucose or high LDH raise suspicion. Consider direct thoracentesis to clarify colonization vs infection.

Treating IPC infection: Superficial—7–10 days oral anti‑staphylococcal regimen; deep—4–6 weeks antibiotics plus drainage through the IPC; add IET (tPA 10 mg + DNase 5 mg up to 3 days) for loculated infected fluid. Avoid routine catheter removal if draining and the patient improves.

Risk modifiers: Infection risk increases with hepatic hydrothorax and dwell time. Concurrent systemic cancer therapy does not clearly increase IPC infection risk.

Talc quality matters: Use graded / larger‑particle talc to minimize systemic absorption and ARDS risk; non‑graded/small‑particle talc is associated with more fever and gas‑exchange impairment.

Chest tube size & pain: Smaller tubes (≤14F) reduce pain. Some data suggest slightly higher failure with 12F vs 24F in mixed cohorts; overall, small‑bore tubes are acceptable for slurry with careful patient selection.

Catheter‑tract metastasis: Occurs in mesothelioma (≈5–10%). Warn patients and plan prophylaxis/monitoring as locally preferred.

When pleurodesis fails: Look for trapped lung or incomplete drainage/loculations. IPCs are preferred when lung does not re‑expand.

Pearls & Pitfalls

Pearl: Deep IPC infection often leads to spontaneous pleurodesis—a common exam pivot.

Pitfall: Treating colonization as infection—positive cultures alone (especially coagulase‑negative staph) don’t mandate antibiotics.

Pitfall: Relying on prophylactic antibiotics at insertion—they do not reduce IPC infection risk.

Pearl: Outpatient IPC pathways with structured drainage (± talc via IPC) are safe, effective, and board‑relevant.

Core Concepts
Pathophysiology & Epidemiology

Pleurodesis creates inflammatory symphysis between parietal and visceral pleura, dependent on apposition; mediators include TGF‑β, VEGF, and bFGF.

IPCs are tunneled, cuffed silicone catheters with a one‑way valve to enable intermittent outpatient drainage and autopleurodesis through pleural apposition and catheter friction.

MPE signals advanced malignancy; objectives are symptom palliation, minimizing hospital days, and avoiding repeated interventions.

Indications & Contraindications

Indications

MPE with expected expandable lung: Either IPC or talc pleurodesis is appropriate; consider IPC for limited life expectancy or desire for outpatient management.

Trapped lung / non‑expandable lung: IPC favored.

Pleurodesis failure or recurrence: IPC or combined strategies (thoracoscopic poudrage + IPC; talc via IPC).

NMPE (selected): Consider in refractory cases (e.g., CHF after maximal therapy; selected hepatic hydrothorax cases with caution). Evidence is weaker than for MPE.

Relative Contraindications

Critically ill patients with high oxygen needs may not tolerate the inflammatory response of chemical pleurodesis.

Severe coagulopathy without correction for interventions; local infection at insertion site.

Pre‑procedure Evaluation

Confirm diagnosis and lung expandability (imaging ± ultrasound).

Baseline labs (CBC, coagulation, renal/liver tests if relevant); optimize anticoagulation management per local protocols.

Discuss goals (hospital‑free days vs device‑free chest), home support for drainage, and infection risks (including tract metastasis risk in mesothelioma).

Equipment & Setup

IPC kits: 15–16F tunneled catheter, insertion sheath, peel‑away dilator, cuff, and drainage bottles.

Talc: Use graded/large‑particle talc; avoid non‑graded/small‑particle talc due to systemic effects.

Chest tubes for slurry: Small‑bore (≤14F) acceptable; larger (24F) may slightly reduce failure in some contexts but at the cost of pain.

Thoracoscopy: Rigid or flex‑rigid thoracoscope for poudrage ± biopsies.

Step‑by‑Step Technique / Procedural Checklists

IPC insertion (ultrasound‑guided, outpatient)

Time‑out; full sterile prep/drape; local anesthesia.

Select entry site at mid‑ to anterior axillary line over fluid pocket.

Create tunneled tract with subcutaneous cuff 2–3 cm from exit site.

Seldinger entry, serial dilation, peel‑away sheath; advance catheter into pleural space.

Confirm flow; secure catheter; apply sterile dressing.

Initial drainage: up to 1 L; prescribe home drainage schedule (daily for “aggressive” protocol vs alternate days).

Talc slurry through chest tube (inpatient or short stay)

Drain effusion to appose pleura.

Premedicate/analgesia (local lidocaine into pleura ± systemic opioid/NSAID).

Instill talc slurry (dose per local protocol) via tube; do not rely on patient rotation—not beneficial.

Gentle suction may be applied (−10 to −20 cm H₂O) to maintain apposition.

Remove tube when drainage is low and patient is comfortable; early removal within 24–48 h is reasonable if clinically stable.

Thoracoscopic talc poudrage (medical thoracoscopy)

Conscious sedation or GA per institutional practice.

Complete diagnostic evaluation/biopsies; evacuate fluid; inspect pleura.

Evenly insufflate dry talc across parietal pleura.

Place drain; typical LOS is short with good efficacy.

Troubleshooting & Intra‑procedure Management

Pain: Intrathoracic lidocaine (2–3 mg/kg total) reduces pleurodesis pain; NSAIDs do not impair pleurodesis success; avoid systemic steroids if possible.

Non‑draining IPC: Check kinks, ensure valve function, flush; suspect loculations—ultrasound guidance helps.

Loculations/septations: Consider IET (e.g., tPA 10 mg + DNase 5 mg daily up to 3 days). Use imaging to monitor clearance.

Air leak / re‑expansion symptoms: Clamp or reduce suction; manage conservatively; avoid rapid large‑volume drainage in frail patients.

Post‑procedure Care & Follow‑up

IPC drainage prescriptions

Aggressive: Daily (up to ~1 L) to accelerate autopleurodesis.

Standard: Alternate days or symptom‑guided.

Dressing care; ensure clean, dry site; educate on warning signs (fever, new pain, cloudy fluid).

For pleurodesis via chest tube: reassess for tube removal within 24–72 h; early removal shortens LOS without hurting success in selected patients.

Complications—Prevention, Recognition, Management

Infection (≈5–6% overall):

Superficial (cellulitis/tunnel/exit‑site): 7–10 days oral anti‑staph therapy; remove IPC only if non‑resolving.

Deep (pleural space): 4–6 weeks antibiotics + drainage via IPC; add IET if loculated; most can be treated without catheter removal.

Colonization: Positive cultures without clinical infection (often coagulase‑negative staph) → no antibiotics.

Catheter‑tract metastasis: Especially in mesothelioma (~5–10%). Discuss risks; local measures (e.g., radiotherapy practices vary).

Loculated non‑draining effusion after IPC: IET can restore drainage; prior talc does not increase septation risk when IPC is later placed.

Empyema after talc: Risk increases with prolonged drainage/antecedent antibiotics; use graded talc and minimize dwell time.

Systemic talc effects: Prefer graded talc to reduce fever and gas‑exchange impairment; avoid non‑graded/small‑particle talc.

Special Populations

Hepatic hydrothorax: IPC infection risk is higher; pleurodesis success is modest and complications are significant—proceed cautiously, ideally in MDT with hepatology.

Heart failure: IPC may help refractory cases; adding poudrage in selected patients increases pleurodesis success.

Immunosuppressed/chemotherapy: Systemic therapy does not clearly increase IPC infection risk; pause during active deep infection and resume once controlled.

Evidence & Outcomes (select trials and themes)

TIME2: IPC vs talc slurry—similar early dyspnea relief; IPC shorter hospital stay; possible symptom advantage at 6 months.

AMPLE: IPC fewer hospital days and reinterventions than talc pleurodesis; similar quality‑of‑life outcomes.

TAPPS: Thoracoscopic poudrage vs slurry—no difference in 90‑day failure; adverse events similar.

IPC‑PLUS: Talc via IPC improves pleurodesis vs IPC alone without excess catheter obstruction.

ASAP: Daily IPC drainage increases autopleurodesis (and shortens time to it) vs alternate‑day drainage.

OPTIMUM: Outpatient IPC pathways vs inpatient chest tube talc—similar short‑term health‑related quality of life; pleurodesis “failure” higher in IPC arm as defined in the trial (methodologic nuances apply).

IPC infection outcomes: Mortality is low; deep infection frequently followed by pleurodesis.

Bullet algorithm notes

Choose IPC when lung is non‑expandable, life expectancy is short, or outpatient management is prioritized.

Choose talc pleurodesis when patients prefer device‑free chest and can tolerate a short inpatient/ambulatory procedure.

Combination approaches (talc via IPC or poudrage + IPC) increase pleurodesis rates while preserving outpatient care.

Algorithm B: Suspected IPC Infection

Look: Erythema, warmth, tenderness (superficial) vs new cloudy/purulent drainage, fever, pain (deep).

Sample: Swab any exit‑site drainage; send pleural fluid for cell count, pH, glucose, LDH, Gram stain/culture; consider direct thoracentesis if colonization is suspected.

Treat

Superficial: Oral anti‑staph therapy 7–10 days; retain catheter unless persistent cellulitis.

Deep: 4–6 weeks antibiotics; drain via IPC; add IET if loculated; retain IPC if draining and improving.

Avoid: Treating colonization (positive culture alone) with antibiotics; prophylactic antibiotics at insertion.

Cases & Applied Learning

Case 1 — Trapped lung, symptomatic MPE
A 68‑year‑old with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma has recurrent dyspnea. Ultrasound shows moderate effusion; post‑thoracentesis chest radiograph reveals persistent basal pneumothorax ex‑vacuo and pleural rind.
Question: Best next step?
Answer: IPC placement with daily drainage protocol.
Explanation: Trapped lung predicts poor pleurodesis success; IPC allows outpatient control and potential autopleurodesis.

Case 2 — IPC with fever and cloudy output
A 59‑year‑old with breast cancer and IPC develops fevers, pleuritic pain, and new turbid drainage. Pleural fluid shows low pH and glucose; culture pending.
Question: Initial management?
Answer: Start empiric antibiotics for pleural infection and drain via the IPC; plan 4–6 weeks total, tailored to response; consider IET if loculated.
Explanation: Deep infection requires drainage plus prolonged antibiotics; removal is not routine if drainage is adequate.

Case 3 — Positive culture, no symptoms
A 72‑year‑old with IPC for MPE feels well. Routine sample through the IPC grows coagulase‑negative staphylococci; fluid is clear, no fever.
Question: Best management?
Answer: Observation without antibiotics.
Explanation: Colonization does not require antibiotics; avoid over‑treating culture results in isolation.

Case 4 — Choosing slurry vs poudrage
A fit 64‑year‑old with good performance status and expandable lung wants a device‑free chest.
Question: Slurry or poudrage?
Answer: Either is acceptable—similar failure and adverse event rates; choose based on logistics and local expertise.
Explanation: Contemporary RCTs show no significant difference in 90‑day failure.

Controversies, Variability, and Evolving Evidence

Slurry vs poudrage: Modern trials show no clear superiority; choice should reflect local expertise, logistics, and patient preference.

Outpatient IPC with talc via catheter: Demonstrates higher pleurodesis vs IPC alone; adoption varies by program and supply of graded talc.

OPTIMUM findings: Trial‑specific definitions influenced “pleurodesis failure” rates; interpret in context.

Preventing IPC infection: Trials are ongoing (e.g., topical measures such as mupirocin) to determine whether exit‑site strategies reduce infections.

Drug‑eluting IPCs (e.g., silver nitrate coatings): Early human data are encouraging for rapid pleurodesis; broader validation is pending.

NMPE: Evidence base remains limited; individualized decisions with shared decision‑making are essential, particularly in hepatic hydrothorax.

Take‑Home Checklist

Confirm lung expandability before committing to pleurodesis.

Align plan to patient goals: device‑free vs outpatient care vs hospital‑free days.

For trapped lung or short prognosis, start with IPC; consider daily drainage.

If IPC alone is insufficient, add talc via IPC to increase pleurodesis rates.

Use graded talc; provide adequate analgesia (intrapleural lidocaine ± NSAIDs).

Small‑bore tubes are acceptable for slurry; don’t rely on patient rotation.

Diagnose IPC infection clinically; don’t treat colonization.

Superficial infection → short oral course; deep infection → prolonged antibiotics plus drainage; use IET for loculations.

Avoid routine catheter removal in deep infection if draining and improving.

Counsel mesothelioma patients on tract metastasis risk.

In hepatic hydrothorax, weigh higher infection risk carefully; involve hepatology.

Educate patients/caregivers on home drainage, infection signs, and site care.
