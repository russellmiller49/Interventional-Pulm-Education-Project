Pathology: Histology, Cytology, ROSE and Molecular Markers
Exam Mapping & Scope

This chapter maps to core diagnostic domains for interventional pulmonology board review: lung cancer histology and classification; cytology fundamentals; rapid on‑site evaluation (ROSE) workflow and decision‑making; tissue and cell‑block triage for immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), next‑generation sequencing (NGS), and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) testing; PD‑L1 assessment and immune‑response evaluation criteria; and practical algorithms linking specimen type to molecular testing and treatment selection across adenocarcinoma, squamous, and neuroendocrine carcinomas.

Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, learners will be able to:

Distinguish key histologic subtypes of lung cancer and recognize high‑risk architectural patterns in adenocarcinoma.

Apply a specimen‑first approach to cytology and ROSE that preserves diagnostic yield and enables downstream molecular testing.

Select and sequence appropriate biomarker assays (IHC, FISH, PCR, NGS, liquid biopsy) based on clinical question and specimen constraints.

Implement a pragmatic testing algorithm for advanced NSCLC, including PD‑L1 assessment and retesting at progression.

Anticipate pre‑analytic pitfalls (fixatives, decalcifiers, tumor fraction) that degrade assay performance and interpretability.

Integrate immune‑response assessment concepts (RECIST 1.1 vs immune‑modified frameworks) into multidisciplinary decision‑making.

High‑Yield One‑Pager

NSCLC landscape: Adenocarcinoma is the most common lung cancer (~50% of lung cancers; ~60% of NSCLC). Classification follows WHO/IASLC principles with lineage‑defining IHC (TTF‑1/napsin A for adenocarcinoma; p40/p63 for squamous).

Adenocarcinoma patterns: AIS (≤3 cm pure lepidic, non‑invasive), MIA (≤0.5 cm invasion), and invasive patterns (acinar, papillary, micropapillary, solid). Micropapillary and solid patterns correlate with aggressive behavior; cribriform architecture is adverse and enriched in ALK/ROS1‑rearranged tumors.

Squamous cell carcinoma: Smoking‑associated; keratinizing vs non‑keratinizing vs basaloid. Use p40/p63 to secure lineage when morphology is limited.

Neuroendocrine spectrum: Typical/atypical carcinoid (lower‑to‑intermediate grade) versus high‑grade small cell carcinoma (SCLC) and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC). SCLC shows nuclear molding, very high Ki‑67; LCNEC has neuroendocrine morphology with high mitotic index.

Staging pearls (AJCC 8th): T descriptors refined by invasive size for part‑solid tumors; AIS/MIA as Tis; updated handling of multifocal ground‑glass/lepidic lesions and pneumonic‑type adenocarcinoma.

ROSE goals: Confirm lesional sampling, optimize smearing/rapid stain quality, reduce non‑diagnostic passes, and triage material in real time for cell block and molecular testing.

Sample triage: Reserve cores or dedicated FNA passes for cell block/NGS; avoid heavy‑metal fixatives and acid decalcifiers; document tumor fraction and necrosis.

Platform fit: IHC for proteins (ALK, ROS1, PD‑L1, BRAF V600E, NTRK); FISH for gene rearrangements or amplification (ALK, ROS1, RET, METamp); PCR/NGS for mutations, fusions, copy number changes; plasma ctDNA for selected contexts (e.g., EGFR T790M at progression).

Driver alterations: EGFR exon 18–21 sensitizing variants (~15% Western, up to ~50% East Asian); ALK 3–5%; ROS1 ~1–2%; BRAF ~2–4% (V600E ~50% of BRAF); MET exon‑14 skipping ~5%; RET ~1–2%; NTRK ~1–2%; KRAS the most frequent oncogenic driver overall (notably G12C subset).

PD‑L1 testing: Multiple validated IHC clones/assays exist; report tumor‑cell membrane staining as percentage (and immune‑cell score where applicable). Use the assay linked to the intended therapy when specified.

Liquid biopsy: Useful when tissue is unsafe or exhausted and for certain resistance questions; negative plasma must trigger tissue biopsy if the result would alter management.

Immune‑response assessment: Responses can be delayed; pseudoprogression is uncommon. iRECIST introduces “iUPD” with mandatory confirmation, but RECIST 1.1 remains the standard for most trials and clinical decisions.

Common exam trap: Reporting PD‑L1 on a crushed, necrotic, or scant sample without pathologist comment on adequacy—can mislead therapy selection.

Pearl: For poorly differentiated NSCLC on small biopsy/cytology, never overcall subtype without lineage‑defining IHC—write “NSCC, favor adeno/squamous.”

Pitfall: Using decalcified bone biopsies for NGS—acid decalcification degrades nucleic acid and increases test failure.

Core Concepts
Pathophysiology / Epidemiology

Lung cancers divide broadly into NSCLC (adenocarcinoma, squamous, large cell variants) and SCLC. Adenocarcinoma predominates and now commonly presents in peripheral and central locations. Histologic subclassification matters because growth patterns carry prognostic information and may correlate with molecular alterations.

Neuroendocrine neoplasms form a biologic spectrum; SCLC and LCNEC are high‑grade with high mitotic rates and Ki‑67, whereas carcinoids are lower grade.

Indications & Contraindications

Indications for ROSE and cytology‑driven workflows

Peripheral or mediastinal lesions sampled by EBUS‑TBNA, EUS‑FNA, navigational bronchoscopy, transthoracic FNA.

Patients with limited fitness for repeated procedures or with lesions in locations where adequacy is challenging.

Situations in which real‑time triage is critical (anticipated need for IHC, FISH, NGS, PD‑L1).

Relative contraindications / limits

Inability to obtain representative cellular material due to necrosis or hemorrhage.

Bony metastases requiring decalcification (prefer alternative sites or EDTA decalcification).

Pre‑procedure Evaluation (Pathology‑Centered)

Pre‑brief with cytopathology: Clarify the primary clinical question (diagnosis vs staging vs molecular profiling), tests likely needed, and preferred fixatives.

Specimen planning: Allocate dedicated passes for cell block (for IHC/PD‑L1), for nucleic acid extraction (NGS), and optional passes for on‑site smears (Diff‑Quik/rapid H&E) to assess adequacy.

Fixative strategy: FFPE is the standard for IHC/FISH/NGS; alcohol‑based fixatives are acceptable for cytology; avoid heavy‑metal fixatives and acid decalcifiers which degrade DNA/RNA and protein epitopes.

Equipment & Setup

ROSE cart: clean labeled slides, Diff‑Quik or equivalent rapid stain kit, alcohol jars for Pap‑fixed slides, glass containers for cell‑block fixative, sterile saline for needle rinses, and documentation tools.

For EBUS/EUS, coordinate needle gauge and number of passes with bronchoscopist/interventionalist; ensure immediate transfer of material for smears and cell block.

Step‑by‑Step Technique / Procedural Checklist

Target confirmation (ultrasound/fluoroscopy/CT‑navigation) and needle pass.

Smear preparation

Expel a tiny droplet; make thin smears with gentle “pull‑apart” or “feathering”; prepare at least one air‑dried smear for rapid staining and one alcohol‑fixed smear for Pap.

Avoid thick, crushed smears; label immediately.

Rapid stain & adequacy call

Evaluate cellularity, tumor cells vs benign elements, necrosis, lymph node sampling (e.g., lymphoid background for station nodes), and lesional confirmation.

Triage in real time

If malignant cells present: prioritize cell block and a dedicated nucleic‑acid tube (e.g., needle rinse) before additional smears.

Reserve tissue for PD‑L1, ALK/ROS1 IHC/FISH, and NGS panel; limit unnecessary stains on scant material.

Iterate passes

If scant cellularity or necrosis, request additional passes and adjust sampling angle/needle position.

Documentation

Record adequacy, suspected lineage (“favor adeno/squamous”), and whether material has been reserved for molecular testing.

Troubleshooting & Intra‑procedure Management

Bloody smears: Use minimal pressure, favor cell‑block capture (clot‑trap) and rinse technique.

Air‑drying artifact: Ensure prompt fixation of Pap slides; keep air‑dried slides for Diff‑Quik only.

Crush artifact: Gentle spreading; avoid grinding.

Necrosis‑only cores: Redirect sampling; target viable rim.

Inadequate tumor fraction for NGS: Request additional lesional passes; consider plasma ctDNA as an adjunct if tissue is unobtainable and the clinical question is actionable.

Post‑procedure Care & Follow‑up (Pathology Workflow)

Integrated report: Provide final subtype with lineage‑defining IHC when needed; explicitly state adequacy for PD‑L1 and NGS.

Reflex testing policy: Many centers reflexively test advanced NSCLC for key drivers (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, RET, MET exon 14 skipping, KRAS) and PD‑L1 at diagnosis.

At progression: Re‑biopsy or plasma testing to evaluate resistance mechanisms (e.g., EGFR T790M; small‑cell transformation).

Complications (from a Diagnostic Perspective)

False‑negative risk: Scant cellularity, excessive necrosis, or unrecognized mucinous tumors (TTF‑1 can be negative in invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma).

Analytical failure: Acid decalcification, heavy‑metal fixatives, prolonged cold ischemia.

Interpretive pitfalls: PD‑L1 scoring on crushed tissue; misclassification of solid adenocarcinoma as squamous without IHC.

Special Populations and Patterns

Invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma: Often KRAS‑mutated; TTF‑1 frequently negative; can mimic metastatic GI mucinous tumors on morphology and IHC.

High‑grade patterns (solid/micropapillary): Higher recurrence risk; vigilance for lymphovascular invasion and spread through air spaces.

Sarcomatoid carcinoma: Enriched for MET exon‑14 skipping; prioritize comprehensive NGS.

Evidence & Outcomes (Selected)

Predictive biomarker testing has transformed NSCLC management; sensitizing EGFR mutations (exons 18–21) predict benefit from EGFR TKIs. Resistance commonly involves T790M.

Targetable fusions (ALK, ROS1, RET, NTRK) and MET exon‑14 skipping respond to matched TKIs.

PD‑L1 expression by validated assays informs immune checkpoint inhibitor use; response can occur across PD‑L1 strata with regimen‑specific nuances.

Parallel bullets (Algorithm 1):

Confirm lesional sampling with ROSE; if nondiagnostic, immediately redirect.

Reserve cell block early; avoid exhausting material on nonessential smears.

Use NGS‑first when feasible for multiplex detection; deploy IHC/FISH as orthogonal or triage tools when tissue is limited or a specific fusion is suspected.

Perform PD‑L1 on cell block with a validated assay.

At progression, use plasma ctDNA to rapidly screen for actionable resistance; negative plasma (when management would change) should prompt tissue re‑biopsy.

Parallel bullets (Algorithm 2):

Adenocarcinoma/NSCC‑NOS: Comprehensive NGS (with fusion detection) + PD‑L1 up front.

Squamous: PD‑L1 for all; consider NGS in never/light smokers, young patients, or small biopsies where misclassification risk exists.

Negative plasma assays are not definitive—confirm with tissue if actionable change is expected.

Re‑testing at progression should include consideration of histologic transformation (e.g., to SCLC).

Cases & Applied Learning

Case 1
A 67‑year‑old former smoker undergoes EBUS‑TBNA of a 4R node. ROSE shows malignant cells in cohesive clusters without keratinization. TTF‑1 is positive; p40 is negative on cell block. What is the next best step to enable optimal therapy selection?
A. Order PD‑L1 only
B. Order ALK FISH only
C. Order comprehensive DNA±RNA NGS panel and PD‑L1 on the same cell block
D. Repeat EBUS for more tissue before any testing
E. Order pan‑TRK IHC only
Answer: C. In advanced NSCLC with adenocarcinoma lineage, reflex comprehensive NGS (including fusions) and PD‑L1 on the available cell block maximizes yield and turnaround while preserving tissue.

Case 2
A patient with EGFR‑mutated lung adenocarcinoma progresses after first‑generation EGFR TKI. Plasma ctDNA is negative for T790M. What is the next best step?
A. Switch to immunotherapy monotherapy
B. Tissue re‑biopsy of progressing site for resistance testing
C. Start chemotherapy without further testing
D. Order ALK IHC
E. Repeat plasma in 6 months
Answer: B. Negative plasma does not exclude T790M; tissue biopsy is recommended when a positive result would alter management.

A. Report NTRK fusion and start TRK inhibitor
B. Treat as wild‑type
C. Confirm with RNA‑based fusion testing (or FISH) using reserved material or a new sample
D. Disregard IHC due to low specificity
E. Repeat pan‑TRK IHC with a different clone
Answer: C. Pan‑TRK IHC is a screening tool; confirmatory molecular testing is required.

Case 4
Bone metastasis core is decalcified in strong acid and submitted for NGS. The laboratory reports assay failure. What is the best corrective action?

Answer: C.

Controversies, Variability, and Evolving Evidence

PD‑L1 assay comparability: While several assays show broad concordance, analytical differences exist; follow validated, therapy‑linked workflows within your laboratory’s quality system.

TMB and blood‑based biomarkers: Blood TMB may enrich for benefit in select settings, but clinical utility and cutoffs vary; not a routine substitute for established markers.

NGS‑first vs serial single‑gene testing: NGS‑first conserves tissue and time as the number of actionable targets grows; serial testing risks tissue exhaustion and delays.

Liquid biopsy scope: Powerful for certain resistance mechanisms and when tissue is unsafe; negative results require tissue confirmation if management hinges on the finding.

Immune‑response criteria: iRECIST and other immune‑modified criteria refine interpretation, but RECIST 1.1 still anchors most trial endpoints and clinical decisions.

Take‑Home Checklist

Confirm lineage on small samples with TTF‑1/napsin A vs p40/p63 rather than relying on morphology alone.

During ROSE, triage early: secure a cell block and nucleic‑acid material before additional smears.

Avoid acid decalcification and heavy‑metal fixatives for specimens destined for IHC/FISH/NGS.

Use NGS‑first for adenocarcinoma/NSCC‑NOS and selected squamous cases; include fusion detection.

Order PD‑L1 on cell block using a validated clone/assay and report adequacy.

Re‑biopsy or use plasma ctDNA at progression; negative plasma does not rule out actionable resistance.

Flag high‑risk adenocarcinoma patterns (micropapillary/solid; cribriform).

Document tumor fraction and necrosis; request additional passes when needed.

Communicate specimen limitations and caveats (e.g., crush, necrosis) in PD‑L1 and molecular interpretations.

Coordinate with the multidisciplinary team to align testing strategy, turnaround, and therapy decisions.
