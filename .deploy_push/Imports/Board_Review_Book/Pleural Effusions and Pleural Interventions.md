Pleural Effusions and Pleural Interventions
Exam Mapping & Scope

This chapter maps to the AABIP/CAQ domains covering the diagnostic approach to pleural effusions and the full spectrum of pleural procedures: thoracic ultrasound (TUS), diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis (including pleural manometry), image‑guided pleural catheter/needle interventions, chest tube selection and management, intrapleural therapy for pleural infection, malignant pleural effusion (MPE) pathways (IPC vs pleurodesis), and medical thoracoscopy (MT). Emphasis is on exam‑relevant decision‑making, stepwise technique, complication avoidance, and the evolving evidence base.

Learning Objectives

By the end, learners will be able to:

Classify pleural effusions and prioritize diagnostic testing using a high‑yield, ultrasound‑first algorithm.

Perform safe, real‑time ultrasound‑guided thoracentesis with appropriate patient selection, set‑up, and manometry‑guided large‑volume drainage.

Select and place small‑bore vs large‑bore chest drains; choose water seal vs suction; troubleshoot air leak, blockage, malposition, and RPE risk.

Construct management pathways for pleural infection (IOABx + tube vs fibrinolytics + DNase vs surgery) and MPE (serial taps vs IPC vs talc pleurodesis vs thoracoscopy).

Recognize and manage special populations (mechanically ventilated, anticoagulated/uremic, trapped/non‑expandable lung, spontaneous/traumatic pneumothorax, hemothorax).

Anticipate, prevent, and manage complications (pneumothorax, hemothorax, infection, RPE, subcutaneous emphysema) and know when post‑procedure imaging is indicated.

High‑Yield One‑Pager (Pearls, Pitfalls, and Common Exam Traps)

Ultrasound is standard of care for thoracentesis and tube placement; it reduces pneumothorax and “dry taps.”

Light’s criteria remain first‑line to classify exudates; borderline values reduce accuracy—use clinical context and ancillary tests.

Large‑volume thoracentesis is safe when guided by symptoms and pleural pressures; stop if Ppl falls below about −20 cm H₂O or the patient develops chest pain/relentless cough.

Do not routinely obtain a post‑tap CXR; reserve for clinical concern (air aspiration, difficult procedure, prior radiation, etc.).

Small‑bore (≤14 F) chest tubes suffice for most effusions and many pneumothoraces; they are better tolerated and placed via Seldinger technique.

When to favor large‑bore: unstable hemothorax/trauma, massive air leak, immediate post‑thoracic surgery (flow and clogging considerations).

Suction is not routine for pneumothorax management; water seal often suffices and may reduce fistula propagation.

Pleural infection: start antibiotics + small‑bore tube early; escalate to intrapleural tPA/DNase if drainage stalls; then surgery if non‑responder.

MPE: symptomatic recurrent effusions → IPC or talc pleurodesis; non‑expandable lung → IPC; talc slurry via small‑bore tube ≈ talc poudrage via thoracoscopy for pleurodesis success.

Ambulatory devices can be considered for carefully selected primary spontaneous pneumothorax; less evidence supports ambulatory care in secondary SP.

RPE is rare but serious; risk increases with very negative pleural pressures, rapid drainage, and poor performance status—treat supportively, clamp/stop if symptoms arise.

Intercostal artery course varies posteriorly—avoid posterior insertion within ~6 cm of the spine and always enter just above the rib to protect the neurovascular bundle.

Drain removal: pneumothorax—when lung is expanded and no air leak; effusions—when output falls (~100–200 mL/24 h) and lung re‑expands.

Post‑procedure ultrasound to confirm residual fluid and tube position is more actionable than routine radiography.

Trapped vs lung entrapment: negative baseline Ppl with minimal change suggests trapped lung; sharp pressure drop during drainage favors entrapment—these patterns guide expectations and pleurodesis candidacy.

Core Concepts
Pathophysiology / Epidemiology

Pleural effusion reflects imbalance in formation vs clearance and has >60 etiologies; ~1.5 million affected annually in the US.

Pneumothorax and pleural infection are major drivers of admissions and procedures; spontaneous pneumothorax shows substantial recurrence if not definitively addressed.

MPE occurs frequently in lung and breast cancer; management prioritizes symptom control, minimizing hospital days, and aligning with prognosis.

Indications & Contraindications

Thoracentesis

Indications: new, unexplained effusion; symptomatic relief; pre‑procedural assessment for definitive MPE interventions.

Contraindications (relative): uncorrected coagulopathy/platelets severely low (mitigate with technique and targeted correction), overlying cellulitis, inability to cooperate; mechanical ventilation is not a contraindication when ultrasound‑guided.

Chest tube (small‑bore preferred for most):

Pleural infection/empyema: early tube drainage + antibiotics.

MPE: inpatient symptom control and/or talc slurry pleurodesis; outpatient symptom control via IPC.

Pneumothorax: symptomatic primary or any secondary/moderate‑large; consider large‑bore if massive leak, ventilated, or traumatic.

Hemothorax: unstable → large‑bore; stable, non‑emergent settings may use 14 F with comparable evacuation and less pain.

Intrapleural fibrinolytics + DNase

Indication: failed initial drainage of pleural infection with persistent sepsis/loculations; if no response, refer for surgery.

Medical Thoracoscopy (MT)

Indications: undiagnosed exudate suspected malignant/TB; therapeutic talc poudrage pleurodesis; adhesiolysis/loculation management in selected cases.

Relative contraindications: severe adhesions preventing safe access, unstable cardiorespiratory status not correctable; use ultrasound to plan entry.

Pre‑procedure Evaluation

Imaging: bedside TUS defines effusion size, complexity, loculations; identifies diaphragm & spleen/liver; and helps predict non‑expandable lung.

Labs/meds: review anticoagulants/antiplatelets; correct severe coagulopathy where feasible; assess renal disease‑related platelet dysfunction; document informed consent.

Risk stratification & consent: address RPE risk factors, respiratory reserve, and patient‑centered goals (especially in MPE).

Pleural fluid orders: cell count & differential, protein/LDH (Light’s criteria), glucose, pH (for parapneumonic risk), cytology when malignancy suspected; ADA, amylase, cholesterol, BNP, or rheumatoid factor selectively.

Equipment & Setup

Thoracentesis kit: sterile drape, 25‑g & 22‑g needles, catheter‑over‑needle, syringes, one‑way valve tubing, specimen vials; optional vacuum bottle or wall suction (see RCTs re: comfort/complications).

Small‑bore drain kit (8–14 F): introducer needle, guidewire, scalpel, serial dilators, pigtail catheter (often curved tip), securing suture, connection to a 3‑chamber collection system.

Pleural drainage system: collection chamber, water‑seal chamber (one‑way), suction control (wet or dry). Digital systems quantify air leak and regulate suction precisely.

Step‑by‑Step Technique / Procedural Checklist

Thoracentesis (real‑time ultrasound‑guided)

Sit patient upright if tolerated; alternative: lateral decubitus (affected side up).

Consent, timeout, vital sign baseline, oxygen as needed.

Ultrasound: select posterior‑lateral interspace, map diaphragm and spleen/liver; avoid posterior spinal region and inferior rib margin.

Sterile prep/drape; local anesthesia: create a subcutaneous wheal (25‑g), then infiltrate along the planned tract with 22‑g needle down to pleura.

Single pass with catheter‑over‑needle just superior to the rib; aspirate fluid, advance catheter, remove needle.

Drain with syringe/one‑way valve tubing; consider manometry if targeting large volumes or if symptoms arise.

Stop for chest pain, relentless cough, vasovagal, or Ppl ≲ −20 cm H₂O; cap and remove during expiration; occlusive dressing.

No routine CXR; obtain if air aspiration, multiple attempts, symptoms, or prior chest irradiation/surgery.

Small‑bore chest tube (Seldinger)

Review imaging & labs; place patient for optimal lateral access; continuous monitoring; ultrasound‑mark site.

Sterile prep/drape; anesthetize subcutaneous tissues and parietal pleura generously (avoid injecting contaminated fluid back into the tract).

Introduce needle while aspirating; pass guidewire 15–20 cm into pleura; remove needle.

Skin nick; serial dilation; advance catheter (pigtail) over wire; remove wire; secure with suture; connect to water seal (± suction).

Post‑placement check: confirm drainage/air flow and patient stability; obtain CXR selectively; consider bedside ultrasound for tube position.

Troubleshooting & Intra‑procedure Management

No fluid returns on thoracentesis: ensure coaxial with finder path, check for kink; re‑scan; consider lateral/anterior pocket.

Dry tap despite imaging: ultrasound often rescues up to ~88% of such cases; re‑map and reattempt.

Chest tube blockage: flush with sterile saline; check for kinks; reposition patient; verify side holes are intrathoracic.

Persistent air leak: verify intrathoracic position; avoid excessive suction in pneumothorax; consider digital systems; escalate for bronchoscopy or surgery if prolonged.

Subcutaneous emphysema: evaluate for malposition or blocked tube; ensure ports are intrapleural; supportively manage.

RPE signals: new hypoxemia + cough/chest pain/infiltrates after large drainage → stop/clamp, oxygen and supportive care.

Post‑procedure Care & Follow‑up

Thoracentesis: observe for vasovagal events; reassess dyspnea; promote incentive spirometry; no routine imaging.

Chest tubes: maintain water seal; apply suction selectively; check system (air leak chamber, suction indicator); daily outputs guide removal.

Removal: pneumothorax—no air leak and re‑expansion; effusions—output ~100–200 mL/24 h with expansion. Valsalva or end‑expiratory removal; petroleum gauze closure.

Complications (Prevention, Recognition, Management)

Pneumothorax (most frequent after thoracentesis): minimized by real‑time ultrasound and a single controlled pass.

Bleeding: protect intercostal bundle by entering just above rib; posterior 6 cm “danger zone” near spine increases unpredictable vessel course; manage with pressure/cautery; rare major hemorrhage.

Infection: sterile technique; drain‑site infections and empyema are uncommon.

Hemothorax: usually intercostal arterial injury; suspect with bloody tap and rapid reaccumulation.

RPE: rare but potentially severe; manage supportively; avoid overly negative pressures or forced suction‑driven rapid evacuation.

Special Populations

Mechanically ventilated: thoracentesis is safe with ultrasound; for tube placement in high PEEP/FiO₂, coordinate short periods of minimal circuit disruption.

Anticoagulation/uremia: many pleural procedures can proceed with careful technique; for high‑risk scenarios, adjust/hold agents when feasible and correct platelets/INR selectively.

Obesity: longer skin‑to‑pleura distance favors ultrasound planning and often benefits from extra‑long tubes to avoid malposition/cuff leak.

Spontaneous pneumothorax (SP): conservative management for selected primary SP; otherwise aspiration or small‑bore tube; ambulatory devices only in reliable primary SP patients with close follow‑up; secondary SP less suitable for ambulatory pathways.

Hemothorax: stable, non‑massive collections may be managed with 14 F drains; unstable/massive needs immediate large‑bore drainage and surgical consultation.

Trapped or non‑expandable lung: anticipate with ultrasound/manometry; avoid talc pleurodesis; favor IPC for symptom control.

Evidence & Outcomes (Selected)

Ultrasound guidance lowers pneumothorax risk and increases success of fluid drainage after failed blind taps; it also helps predict non‑expandable lung by pleural/lung dynamics.

Manometry‑guided large‑volume thoracentesis minimizes RPE; symptom‑limited drainage is acceptable when manometry is unavailable.

In pleural infection, tube size does not worsen outcomes, while larger tubes increase pain; early drainage + antibiotics is foundational, with tPA/DNase improving clearance and reducing surgery in non‑responders.

In MPE, IPC and talc pleurodesis both palliate dyspnea effectively; IPC reduces inpatient days; talc slurry via small‑bore tube and talc poudrage have similar pleurodesis success when appropriately selected.

For pneumothorax, routine suction offers no clear advantage over water seal and may perpetuate fistula flow; conservative care can be effective in select primary SP.

Parallel bulleted algorithm

Confirm clinical context; if classic transudate (e.g., CHF) and improves with therapy, thoracentesis may be deferred.

Perform ultrasound, then diagnostic thoracentesis with appropriate labs.

Parapneumonic/empyema: antibiotics + early small‑bore tube if complicated features (pus, low pH, loculations).

If drainage stalls, consider tPA/DNase; persistently septic/non‑draining → surgical referral.

MPE: use cytology; choose IPC vs talc pleurodesis based on symptoms, expandability, and patient goals; trapped lung → IPC.

Suspected TB/other: add ADA/cultures and pursue image‑guided biopsy or MT if needed.

Parallel bulleted algorithm

Air: primary SP → aspiration or small‑bore tube; ambulatory device in selected, reliable patients. Secondary SP/trauma → small‑bore for most; large‑bore if massive leak/vent/instability.

Fluid: infection → small‑bore tube; escalate with tPA/DNase if needed. MPE → small‑bore for inpatient drainage/talc slurry; IPC for outpatient palliation or non‑expandable lung. Hemothorax → large‑bore if unstable/massive; 14 F acceptable in stable non‑emergent settings.

Suction: not routine in pneumothorax; use minimally and reassess; caution with effusions to reduce RPE risk.

Removal: with expansion and appropriate thresholds (no air leak; or output ≤100–200 mL/24 h).

Cases & Applied Learning

Case 1
A 68‑year‑old with CHF responds partially to diuresis but remains dyspneic with a large right effusion. Bedside TUS confirms a simple, free‑flowing effusion. What’s the best next step?
Best answer: Ultrasound‑guided thoracentesis with diagnostic studies and symptom‑guided large‑volume drainage.
Why: Even in likely transudate, atypical features or incomplete response justify diagnostic/therapeutic tapping; ultrasound reduces complications and improves success.

Case 2
A 55‑year‑old with community‑acquired pneumonia has a septated effusion, pH 7.05, and persistent fevers after antibiotics.
Best answer: Small‑bore chest tube drainage plus consideration of intrapleural tPA/DNase.
Why: Complicated parapneumonic effusion needs prompt drainage; fibrinolytics improve clearance and reduce surgery in non‑responders.

Case 3
A 72‑year‑old with metastatic breast cancer has recurrent dyspnea weekly from a unilateral effusion; ultrasound reveals poor lung expansion after prior tap.
Best answer: Indwelling pleural catheter.
Why: Non‑expandable lung favors IPC for outpatient palliation and fewer hospital days; pleurodesis is unlikely to succeed.

Question Bank (12 MCQs)

1. A 67‑year‑old with a new unilateral effusion and no clear systemic cause. Best initial diagnostic step?
   A. CT pulmonary angiography
   B. Blind thoracentesis at the posterior axillary line
   C. Ultrasound‑guided diagnostic thoracentesis
   D. Immediate IPC placement
   E. PET‑CT
   Answer: C. Ultrasound guidance is standard, increases success, and reduces pneumothorax; diagnostic sampling directs further care.

2. During therapeutic thoracentesis, the patient develops pleuritic chest pain and persistent cough after 1.3 L removed; manometry shows Ppl −22 cm H₂O. Next best step?
   A. Continue drainage to dryness
   B. Stop drainage; supportive care; consider staged drainage
   C. Start suction to speed drainage
   D. Give loop diuretic and proceed
   E. Convert to chest tube
   Answer: B. Pain + very negative pressure suggests risk for RPE—stop/clamp and support.

3. Which post‑thoracentesis patient needs a chest radiograph?
   A. Uneventful single‑pass tap with good symptom relief
   B. Aspiration of air bubbles during the procedure
   C. Small vasovagal episode resolved with Trendelenburg
   D. None; always omit CXR
   E. All patients
   Answer: B. Imaging is reserved for concern such as air aspiration, difficult tap, symptoms, or specific risk factors.

4. Procedural troubleshooting. You cannot aspirate fluid despite ultrasound‑confirmed effusion at 4 cm depth. Best next action?
   A. Convert to large‑bore chest tube
   B. Re‑scan to confirm window; check catheter for kinking; ensure entry just above rib; consider a more posterior/lateral site
   C. Apply wall suction
   D. Ask the patient to cough
   E. Immediate CT
   Answer: B. Trouble‑shoot the tract and device; ultrasound rescues most “dry taps.”

5. A 60‑year‑old with complicated parapneumonic effusion has persistent sepsis and multiloculations after 48 h of small‑bore drainage. Best escalation?
   A. Replace with 28 F tube
   B. Intrapleural tPA/DNase
   C. Start routine suction at −40 cm H₂O
   D. Remove tube; repeat thoracentesis
   E. Observe another 72 h
   Answer: B. Fibrinolytics enhance drainage; routine large‑bore replacement alone does not improve outcomes.

6. In MPE with expandable lung, which option best minimizes inpatient days while maintaining symptom control?
   A. Serial thoracenteses only
   B. Indwelling pleural catheter
   C. Talc poudrage via thoracoscopy only
   D. Large‑bore chest tube on suction
   E. NSAIDs and observation
   Answer: B. IPCs reduce hospital days; pleurodesis is reasonable when inpatient and expandable lung, but IPC is often superior for outpatient burden.

7. Chest drain management for secondary SP on the ward with steady air leak and no distress. Which is preferred?
   A. Water seal without routine suction, monitor air leak
   B. Immediate −40 cm H₂O suction
   C. Clamp the tube
   D. Remove the tube
   E. Switch to a Heimlich valve for discharge
   Answer: A. Suction is not routinely recommended; water seal is often adequate.

8. Stable hemothorax after blunt trauma in a monitored setting. Best initial drain choice?
   A. 14 F small‑bore catheter
   B. 28–32 F chest tube mandatory
   C. IPC
   D. Thoracentesis
   E. Observe only
   Answer: A. In stable, non‑emergent hemothorax, 14 F shows comparable evacuation with less pain; unstable/massive → large‑bore.

9. Which finding most strongly suggests trapped lung during thoracentesis?
   A. Late precipitous pressure drop after initial normal pressure
   B. Negative baseline pleural pressure with minimal change despite drainage
   C. Pleural pressure remains slightly positive after 2 L removed
   D. High ADA level
   E. Cloudy fluid with high LDH
   Answer: B. Negative starting Ppl with little change indicates trapped lung.

10. Best next step for a patient with recurrent MPE, poor performance status, and non‑expandable lung after a complete tap?
    A. Talc slurry pleurodesis via small‑bore tube
    B. Talc poudrage via thoracoscopy
    C. IPC placement
    D. Repeat thoracentesis every few days
    E. Pleurectomy
    Answer: C. IPC is preferred for trapped/non‑expandable lung.

11. After small‑bore tube placement for empyema, drainage suddenly stops; the patient develops subcutaneous emphysema. First action?
    A. Clamp the tube
    B. Apply high suction
    C. Check for kinks/malposition; flush the catheter; verify that side ports are intrapleural
    D. Remove the tube immediately
    E. Place a second large‑bore tube
    Answer: C. Troubleshoot system and tube position first.

12. Which statement about pleurodesis in MPE is most accurate?
    A. Talc poudrage is clearly superior to talc slurry
    B. Talc slurry via small‑bore tube and talc poudrage have similar success when properly selected
    C. Large‑bore tubes improve pleurodesis rates
    D. Pleurodesis is preferred for non‑expandable lung
    E. Suction is required for all pleurodeses
    Answer: B. Both strategies are acceptable; tube size does not determine success, and trapped lung favors IPC rather than pleurodesis.

Controversies, Variability, and Evolving Evidence

Gravity vs suction‑driven thoracentesis: Randomized data suggest similar discomfort; some reports associate vacuum with higher complications. Symptom‑ or manometry‑guided drainage remains central.

Routine suction for pneumothorax: Guidance discourages default suction; consider water seal first to avoid perpetuating fistula flow.

Ambulatory management of pneumothorax: Robust for selected primary SP; less support in secondary SP.

Fibrinolytics + DNase vs early VATS for empyema: Both pathways exist; intrapleural therapy is effective in many non‑responders to initial drainage and may reduce surgery; surgical decortication remains essential for refractory cases.

Talc slurry vs poudrage: Contemporary RCTs show broadly similar pleurodesis success when patients are selected appropriately; institutional expertise and logistics guide choice.

Take‑Home Checklist (8–15 Actionable Bullets)

Use ultrasound for every pleural procedure—define the pocket, depth, and safe window.

Enter just above the rib; avoid posterior insertion within ~6 cm of the spine.

For large‑volume taps, consider manometry or symptom‑guided stopping rules; avoid excessive negative pressures.

Prefer small‑bore tubes for most effusions and many pneumothoraces; reserve large‑bore for unstable hemothorax, massive leak, or immediate post‑thoracic surgery.

Do not default to suction in pneumothorax; start with water seal.

Empyema: antibiotics + small‑bore drainage early; escalate to tPA/DNase if output stalls; refer for surgery if persistent.

MPE: choose IPC vs talc pleurodesis based on symptoms, expandability, and goals; trapped lung → IPC.

No routine post‑tap CXR; image for signs/suspicion of complications.

Secure and dress tubes well; flush to prevent blockage; verify intrapleural side ports.

Remove tubes when air leak stops (pneumothorax) or output ≤100–200 mL/24 h with lung expansion (effusions).

Anticipate RPE—recognize early and treat supportively; stop drainage if concerning symptoms or very negative pressures.

Document patient‑centered goals, especially in MPE.
