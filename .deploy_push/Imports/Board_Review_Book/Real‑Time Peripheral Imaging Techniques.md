Real‑Time Peripheral Imaging Techniques
Exam Mapping & Scope

This chapter covers real‑time imaging used to localize and biopsy peripheral pulmonary lesions during bronchoscopy, focusing on digital tomosynthesis (DTS), cone‑beam CT (CBCT), and augmented fluoroscopy workflows. It maps to AABIP domains on diagnostic bronchoscopy for peripheral nodules, image‑guided navigation, radiation awareness, and intraprocedural troubleshooting.

Learning Objectives

By the end, the learner should be able to:

Explain how DTS and CBCT generate near–real‑time 3D information from limited‑angle X‑ray acquisitions and the practical differences between them.

Describe CT‑to‑body divergence, its causes, and how real‑time imaging mitigates it.

Select an imaging platform (DTS vs CBCT; fixed vs mobile) based on lesion, patient, and resource factors.

Implement anesthesia and ventilation strategies that reduce atelectasis and improve image quality.

Execute step‑by‑step workflows for DTS‑assisted navigation and CBCT‑guided navigation bronchoscopy.

Recognize, prevent, and manage common intraprocedural problems (e.g., atelectasis, motion artifact, tool‑to‑lesion misalignment).

Summarize evidence on diagnostic yield, radiation exposure, safety, and emerging therapeutic uses.

High‑Yield One‑Pager (Pearls, Pitfalls, Traps)

Why real‑time imaging? The major limiter of peripheral bronchoscopy yield is CT‑to‑body divergence—the intraprocedural target often isn’t where the pre‑op CT predicted. Real‑time updates correct the plan before sampling.

DTS vs CBCT: DTS uses a short fluoroscopic sweep (limited angles) to reconstruct slice stacks with low dose and conventional C‑arm compatibility; CBCT rotates a cone beam around the patient to create a 3D volume that can be overlaid on live fluoro (augmented fluoroscopy).

Radiation snapshot: Typical effective doses—CXR (PA): 0.02 mSv; lateral CXR 0.15 mSv; chest DTS 0.1–0.2 mSv; low‑dose chest CT 1.5 mSv; CBCT ~2–2.5 mSv; diagnostic chest CT 4–8 mSv.

Ventilation matters: Atelectasis shifts or obscures targets. Use general anesthesia with neuromuscular blockade when appropriate, PEEP ≥10 cm H₂O, high tidal volumes, and inspiratory breath‑hold for image acquisition.

Timing breath‑hold: Start CBCT scanning 5–7 seconds after initiating breath‑hold to outlast initial lung motion.

Tool‑in‑lesion confirmation: Combine rEBUS when available with the imaging system’s tool/lesion overlay or a quick confirmatory spin/sweep before sampling.

Platforms in practice:

Illumisite™ (DTS‑assisted ENB): fluoroscopic sweep ~±25°; updates target registration.

LungVision™: multimodal image fusion; “main carina spin” and isocenter spin with overlay; compatible with multiple scopes and robots.

Galaxy System™: robotic bronchoscopy with integrated DTS (TiLT+), single‑use scope, cross‑hair targeting.

Evidence signals: DTS‑assisted ENB improves yield vs ENB alone; CBCT‑guided navigation shows high yields and can outperform older techniques; combining CBCT with robotic systems reports yields commonly in the mid‑70s to low‑90s.

Radiation safety: CBCT‑guided navigation typically has median effective dose ≈5–6 mSv, comparable to diagnostic chest CT when optimized.

Complications profile: Pneumothorax rates during navigational bronchoscopy are low; chest tube requirement is uncommon relative to transthoracic needle biopsy.

Common traps:

High FiO₂ with prolonged ventilation → resorption atelectasis.

Imaging performed before instruments are positioned → misleading overlay from device‑induced deformation afterward.

Ignoring lower‑lobe/posterior dependence → missed targets.

Core Concepts
Pathophysiology / Epidemiology (relevant elements)

Peripheral pulmonary nodules are frequently identified on CT screening or incidentally. Conventional 2D fluoroscopy is limited for 3D navigation. Real‑time limited‑angle tomography (DTS) and cone‑beam 3D reconstructions (CBCT) bridge this gap by updating target position and tool‑to‑lesion relationships during the case.

CT‑to‑Body Divergence

Causes include: lower intraprocedural lung volumes vs inspiratory CT, atelectasis (airway occlusion, secretions, FiO₂‑related resorption), and instrument‑induced deformation. Mitigation requires ventilation protocols, breath‑holds, and imaging updates that re‑register the target to current anatomy.

Indications & Contraindications

Indications: Image‑guided bronchoscopy for peripheral nodules, confirmation of tool‑in‑lesion before sampling, compensation for CT‑to‑body divergence, planning and verification for fiducial/marker placement, and support of local therapies (CBCT).

Contraindications: Gap: Not in provided materials.

Pre‑procedure Evaluation

Planning CT:

For Illumisite‑assisted workflows: obtain CT within 4 weeks, slice thickness 1.0–1.25 mm, 0.8–1.0 mm interval with 20–50% overlap.

For LungVision workflows: chest CT slice thickness <1.5 mm.

Anesthesia & Ventilation: Use general anesthesia with neuromuscular blockade when appropriate; PEEP ≥10 cm H₂O reduces atelectasis; coordinate inspiratory breath‑holds for imaging.

Equipment & Setup

DTS: Conventional C‑arm performs a limited‑angle sweep (e.g., ~±25° for Illumisite; ~±30° DTS spin for Galaxy). Reconstruction yields stacked slices; systems display nodule and catheter tip alignment for re‑registration.

CBCT: Fixed or mobile 3D‑capable C‑arm rotates around the patient to reconstruct a 3D volume. Fixed systems support augmented fluoroscopy (overlay of segmented nodules/airways/tools on live fluoro). Mobile systems provide 3D confirmation but typically lack native AF.

Scopes & Channels:

Galaxy: disposable bronchoscope 4.0‑mm OD, 2.1‑mm working channel.

Illumisite: catheter used through a therapeutic scope with 2.8‑mm working channel.

LungVision: disposable mechanical catheter inserted into the bronchoscope working channel; integrates with most C‑arms and navigation platforms.

Step‑by‑Step Technique / Procedural Checklist

A. DTS‑assisted navigation (Illumisite‑style)

Load planning CT and create navigation path.

Intubate; apply neuromuscular blockade; set PEEP ≥10 cm H₂O.

Register airways; advance locatable guide/extended working channel (EWC) toward target—keep the “target marker” in plane.

Within ~25 mm of target, position C‑arm (e.g., LAO 25° start).

Perform inspiratory breath‑hold; execute high‑level, continuous fluoroscopy sweep ~LAO 25° → RAO 25° (~8–30 s).

System reconstructs DTS; mark nodule and catheter tip; update registration.

Correct alignment; confirm with rEBUS when available; sample.

B. DTS‑based augmented fluoroscopy (LungVision‑style)

Plan with thin‑slice CT (<1.5 mm).

After sedation, perform “main carina spin” (narrow‑angle) and register carina on reconstructed imaging and the planning CT.

Use isocenter spin to update target location; overlay navigation plan.

Insert mechanical catheter via bronchoscope; steer along system display; confirm tool‑lesion relationship on multiplanar/3D views; sample.

C. Robotic bronchoscopy with integrated DTS (Galaxy‑style)

Navigate robotically near lesion (electromagnetic navigation).

Engage TiLT+ (tool‑in‑lesion tomosynthesis) and perform a –30° to +30° spin near isocenter.

Identify target; update target location; use cross‑hair view to center lesion relative to the tip; sample with robot’s stable platform.

D. CBCT‑guided navigation bronchoscopy (with augmented fluoroscopy when available)

Pre‑plan airway path; wedge bronchoscope/EWC into target subsegment.

Breath‑hold and first CBCT spin; segment target and (optionally) the distal EWC tip; choose optimal AF angles.

Use AF to guide EWC/tool to the lesion, correlating overlay with the visible distal tip under live ventilation.

Confirm position by rEBUS and/or a quick confirmatory CBCT (needle seen within lesion).

Sample adequately (needle ± forceps; multiple passes/locations), with ROSE if available.

Troubleshooting & Intra‑procedure Management

Atelectasis obscuring the target: Increase PEEP, use high tidal volumes, shorten case time to imaging/sampling, limit FiO₂ when feasible, and time spins to inspiratory breath‑hold. Posterior and lower‑lobe lesions and obesity are higher risk.

Overlay mismatch (CBCT‑to‑body divergence): Ensure instruments are already near target before first spin; mark the distal EWC tip on the 3D volume; correlate overlay with the visible tip under live fluoro; repeat spin if uncertainty persists.

Motion artifact (DTS/CBCT): Minimize sweep/spin time; avoid moving cables/objects in the field; wait 5–7 s after initiating breath‑hold before starting CBCT.

No rEBUS signal: Rely on reconstructed DTS/CBCT with tool visualization; adjust trajectory or consider a trans‑parenchymal path if no airway leads to the lesion (CBCT helps define exit/entry points).

Post‑procedure Care & Follow‑up

Assess for immediate complications; pneumothorax is uncommon with navigational bronchoscopy but should be excluded when indicated. Gap: Detailed observation/protocols not in provided materials.

Complications (prevention, recognition, management)

Navigational bronchoscopy with DTS or CBCT has low pneumothorax rates; chest tube requirement is uncommon. In one randomized comparison of navigational bronchoscopy and transthoracic biopsy, pneumothorax occurred less often with bronchoscopy, and chest tube placement was rare. In early Galaxy experience, pneumothorax occurred infrequently (occasionally requiring drainage). Gap: Comprehensive rates for all platforms not uniformly provided.

Special Populations

Obesity and posterior lower‑lobe lesions: higher atelectasis risk—prioritize ventilation strategies and early imaging.

ICU/limited resources: DTS offers low dose and compatibility with standard C‑arm systems. Gap: Pregnancy/anticoagulation specifics not in provided materials.

Evidence & Outcomes (selected signals from the literature)

DTS‑assisted ENB: Diagnostic yield improved from ~mid‑50s to ~high‑70s when tomosynthesis correction was added; typical divergence corrections ~12–15 mm.

Comparative yield: DTS‑corrected ENB and shape‑sensing robotic bronchoscopy show similar yields in some cohorts (~77–80%).

CBCT‑guided navigation: Meta‑analytic yield approx. ~78% (intermediate definition). CBCT integrated with modern platforms frequently reports yields ~75–93%.

Randomized comparison to TTNB (initial results): Diagnostic yield similar between navigational bronchoscopy and CT‑guided transthoracic biopsy, with fewer complications for bronchoscopy.

Radiation: Optimized CBCT navigation procedures have median effective doses around ~5.5 mSv, similar to diagnostic chest CT.

Move instruments close before imaging (reduces post‑spin deformation).

CBCT: mark distal EWC tip; choose optimal AF angles; correlate overlay with live fluoro.

DTS: perform recalibration sweep and update registration.

Iterate imaging → adjustment until tool‑in‑lesion, then biopsy.

Cases & Applied Learning

Case 1
A 2‑cm posterior lower‑lobe nodule is planned for ENB. After airway registration you see no rEBUS signal; fluoroscopy suggests under‑inflation. The center lacks CBCT but has Illumisite‑enabled C‑arm. Next best step?
A. Increase FiO₂ to 100% and proceed without imaging update
B. Obtain a repeat planning CT
C. Perform an inspiratory breath‑hold limited‑angle DTS sweep and re‑register target/tool, with higher PEEP
D. Convert to transthoracic biopsy immediately
E. Abort and reschedule
Answer: C. Atelectasis and low lung volumes are common causes of divergence. A DTS sweep with re‑registration plus optimized ventilation improves alignment before sampling.

Case 2
A thin‑slice CT shows no bronchus sign to a 15‑mm lateral segment RUL nodule. Fixed CBCT with AF is available. After positioning the EWC near the pleural side, what optimizes success?

B. Mark the distal EWC tip on the CBCT volume and use AF angles to correlate with live fluoro
C. Avoid breath‑hold to simulate normal ventilation
D. Increase suction to collapse the segment
E. Proceed without imaging because rEBUS is negative
Answer: B. Marking the tip and using AF views translates breath‑hold 3D data to ventilated lungs and guides trans‑parenchymal trajectories if needed.

Case 3
A center with shape‑sensing robotic bronchoscopy and mobile CBCT plans biopsy of an 18‑mm GGO‑predominant nodule. rEBUS is equivocal. What is the most appropriate intra‑procedural imaging step?

Answer: B. Typical chest DTS is ~0.1–0.2 mSv; CBCT commonly ~2–2.5 mSv per acquisition.

Controversies, Variability, and Evolving Evidence

DTS vs CBCT: DTS offers speed, low dose, and broad C‑arm compatibility but has limited depth resolution and susceptibility to motion; CBCT provides robust 3D and AF (fixed systems) at higher dose and cost. Head‑to‑head studies and standardized definitions of yield continue to evolve.

Fixed vs mobile CBCT: Fixed systems provide AF and shorter spins; mobile systems increase access and integration with robotics but currently lack native AF and may have longer spin times.

What counts as “diagnostic yield”? Strict vs intermediate definitions (e.g., how nonspecific benign results are adjudicated) influence reported yields; interpretation varies across studies.

Optimal ventilation strategy: Protocols supporting high PEEP/tidal volumes and breath‑holds reduce atelectasis; institutional adoption varies but strongly affects image quality and yield.

Therapies beyond diagnosis: CBCT guidance is essential for precise local treatments; standardized pathways and comparative outcomes are being defined.

Take‑Home Checklist

Confirm resource stack (fixed CBCT/AF → mobile CBCT → DTS) before scheduling.

Acquire thin‑slice planning CT (per platform recommendations).

Use general anesthesia, neuromuscular blockade as needed, PEEP ≥10 cm H₂O, and plan inspiratory breath‑holds for imaging.

Position instruments near the target before first spin/sweep.

For CBCT‑AF: segment the lesion and mark the tool tip; pick progression/angulation AF views.

For DTS: perform the limited‑angle sweep and re‑register the target/tool.

Always confirm tool‑in‑lesion (rEBUS ± imaging) before sampling.

Sample multiple locations within the lesion; use ROSE when available.

If misaligned: re‑image quickly, correct trajectory, and repeat.

Minimize motion and clutter; remove scattering objects from the field.

Monitor for complications; pneumothorax is uncommon but must be recognized early.

Document dose metrics and imaging steps for quality improvement.
