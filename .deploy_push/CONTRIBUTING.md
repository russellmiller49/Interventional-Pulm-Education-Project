# Contributing

Thank you for investing time in the Interventional Pulmonology Collaborative project. Contributions are welcomed from clinicians, engineers, designers, and educators. The project is structured around clearly defined milestonesâ€”please align your contribution with an open milestone issue or propose a new scope before submitting major changes.

## Project Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
2. Create an environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
3. Run quality gates locally:
   ```bash
   pnpm lint
   pnpm type-check
   pnpm test
   ```

## Branching & Commits

- Use descriptive branches (e.g. `feat/m2-navigation`).
- Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. Commitlint enforces message formatting.
- Keep pull requests focused on a single milestone or issue to streamline reviews.

## Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] Tests updated or added where relevant.
- [ ] Tailwind classes deduplicated via `cn` helper or `tailwind-merge`.
- [ ] Accessibility and security considerations documented.
- [ ] Screenshots or recordings for UI-facing changes.

## Code Style

- TypeScript operates in strict mode; prefer explicit types.
- Use the shared `cn` helper for composing class names.
- Prefer composition over inheritance; colocate styles via Tailwind utilities.

## Reporting Issues

Open a GitHub issue with:

- Summary of the problem or feature request.
- Steps to reproduce (if bug).
- Expected vs. actual behaviour.
- Screenshots, logs, or stack traces when available.
